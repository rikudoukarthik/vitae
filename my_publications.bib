When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples.},

The main objective of this study, conducted in temperate deciduous forests in Michigan's Lower Peninsula, was to compare bird use of riparian and upland forests during and after breeding. Using mist-nets, we quantified populations in accordance with the Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) protocol. Nets were set up in both riparian and upland forests in a paired sampling design. After fledging, we captured juveniles, including those of the Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla), at a rate higher in riparian than in upland forests. The trend for adult Ovenbirds was similar. For riparian breeders, we found no difference in capture rates over time between upland and riparian forests; these species appeared to stay in riparian forests after fledging. Our results suggest that riparian forests are important habitat for passerines during the period following fledging; they need to be considered accordingly during conservation planning.},

Here we aim to analyze the niche and spatial distribution of the Magellanic woodpecker (MWP; Campephilus magellanicus), a specialist predator, analyzing the relative importance of its individual prey species, prey species richness and environmental factors. We modeled the niches of the MWP and its five most important long-horned beetle prey species, quantifying their similarity in spatial distribution and niche. Then we evaluated the relative importance of single prey species and prey species richness on the potential distribution of the MWP, which showed a high degree of overlap with the niche and spatial distribution of three prey species. MWP models with each of these three prey species had a better fit than the model with prey species richness, and contributed more than environmental variables. These results suggest that MWP responds to particular prey items rather than prey species richness. These findings highlight the usefulness of ecological niche models to identify behavioral traits, being potentially replicable in other types of interactions such as competition, mutualism, parasitism, and pollination.},

Congeneric passerines had smaller habitat overlaps and breadths than passerines which are not congeneric with other species in the forest. The habitat breadth of foliage-gleaners decreased with the increasing number of coexisting foliage-gleaning species in the same habitats. Both results suggest that interspecific competition modifies the habitat selection of forest birds. Intraspecific competition may partly be responsible for the clear positive correlation between abundance and habitat breadth of foliage-gleaners. Habitat breadths in general were smallest during the breeding season. This appears to be a consequence of special habitat requirements at that time, such as suitable nest-site and shelter against predation. This postulation is supported by the fact that the annual variation in habitat selection during the breeding season was smaller than in other seasons. Intense interspecific competition during breeding can be rejected as an alternative hypothesis, since the reduction in habitat breadths was particularly pronounced for species which were not congeneric with other species in the forest. All species changed their habitat seasonally to some degree, but for some migrants these changes were relatively slight. Overlaps in the habitats of gallinaceous birds were small in winter, and large overlaps in summer might reflect the absence of interspecific competition during the period of maximum food availability. In contrast, habitat overlaps among foliage-gleaners were smallest during the breeding season, which may be due to the restricted habitat selection, irrespective of competition, at that time.}

In the past 50 yr, scores of these migratory species, including some once considered common, have declined dramatically. Nearctic-Neotropical migrants normally spend 6-8 months in tropical habitats, making the identification, availability, and management of Neotropical habitats critical issues for their conservation. Yet, for most species, complete and nuanced information about their use of tropical habitats and the relative effects of breeding vs. wintering conditions on survival, productivity, and population trends is not available, though many studies point to Neotropical overwintering habitats as being a strong driver of population change. Particularly important for long-distance Nearctic-Neotropical migrants is an understanding of how"carry-over effects" arise and influence population trends when conditions on wintering grounds and tropical stopover areas affect subsequent reproductive performance on breeding grounds. For example, why some species show strong carry-over effects from tropical habitats while others do not is not fully understood. I n recent years, many studies have offered insights into these issues by taking advantage of new scientific methods and technological innovations. In this review, we explore threats facing North American breeding birds that migrate to the Neotropics, summarize knowledge of habitat selection and use on the wintering grounds, describe how conditions at one point in the annual cycle may manifest in subsequent seasons or life history stages, and discuss conservation concerns such as climate change and the potential for phenological mismatch.},

Recent advances in bio-logging have revealed the stopover strategies of many long-distance migrants, but far less attention has been given to short-distance migrants. We investigated the stopover ecology of an endangered grassland bird, the Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax, a short-distance migrant in Iberia. Using high-resolution spatial GPS/GSM data, 27 male Little Bustards breeding in southern Portugal were tracked between 2009 and 2011. We studied post-breeding movements using Dynamic Brownian Bridge models to identify the main stopover sites, and generalized linear mixed models to examine habitat selection in stopovers. During their post-breeding movements, males were essentially nocturnal migrants, making frequent stopovers while maintaining a relatively fast pace to reach more productive agricultural post-breeding areas. Stopovers occurred in most post-breeding movements (83\%) regardless of the total distance covered (average 64.3 km), and most stopovers (84\%) lasted less than 24 h. Birds used mostly agricultural non-irrigated and irrigated croplands as stopover sites and avoided other land uses and rugged terrain. There was a negative relationship between stopovers and the proximity to roads, but not to power lines. The high frequency of stopovers during post-breeding movements, despite the short distances travelled, together with the nocturnal migratory behaviour of bustards, may impose additional risks to a bird mainly threatened by collision with power lines in non-breeding areas. We also conclude that even for short-distance migrants, habitat connectivity between breeding and post-breeding areas is likely to be a key conservation concern.},

In the present study, we used one mitochondrial and, for most species, four nuclear loci to infer the phylogeny of this family. We analysed 59 species, including the five previously unsampled genera plus two genera that had not before been analysed in a densely sampled dataset. This study revealed extensive disagreement with current taxonomy; the genera Bradypterus, Locustella, Megalurus, Megalurulus and Schoenicola were all found to be non-monophyletic. Non-monophyly was particularly pronounced for Megalurus, which was widely scattered across the tree. Three of the five monotypic genera (Amphilais, Buettikoferella and Malia) were nested within other genera; one monotypic genus (Chaetornis) formed a clade with one of the two species of Schoenicola; whereas the position of the fifth monotypic genus (Elaphrornis) was unresolved. Robsonius was confirmed as sister to the other genera. We propose a phylogenetically informed revision of genus-level taxonomy, including one new generic name. Finally, we highlight several non-monophyletic species complexes and deep intra-species divergences that point to conflict in taxonomy and suggest an underestimation of current species diversity in this group.},

Data on juvenile survival improve our estimates of population productivity, provide information on factors during the post-fledging period that affect this productivity and, with comparative data, enable us to better assess breeding habitat quality. We present the first estimate of post-fledging juvenile survival in a population of Neotropical migrant birds. We studied post-fledging survival in a population of Wood Thrush ( Hylocichla mustelina) in southern Missouri, (U.S.) an area hypothesized to contain source populations. Nesting success during our study period was 0.266, and individual survival within the nest was 0.245. Post-fledging survival during the first 8 weeks after fledging was 0.423. Survival varied significantly between post-fledging weekly age classes, with survival of weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4 through 8 being 0.716, 0.930, 0.637, and 1.00, respectively. Probability of predation after fledging was 0.506. Probability of mortality by other causes was 0.071. Probability of predation varied by weekly age class and may have been related to behaviors occurring at different developmental stages. Post-fledging survival was not correlated with nestling mass and did not change throughout the course of the breeding season. Analysis of the source/sink status of the population based on our estimates of nesting success and post-fledging survival indicates that young were being produced below replacement levels during our study period. Large-scale management decisions should take into account potential fluctuations in the productivity of Neotropical migrant populations over time. Data on post-fledging juvenile survival are needed from other populations of Neotropical migrant birds to more accurately assess differential productivity between populations and better assess breeding habitat quality.},

  abstract = {This second edition textbook offers an expanded conceptual synthesis of microbial ecology with plant and animal ecology. Drawing on examples from the biology of microorganisms and macroorganisms, this textbook provides a much-needed interdisciplinary approach to ecology. The focus is the individual organism and comparisons are made along six axes: genetic variation, nutritional mode, size, growth, life cycle, and influence of the environment. When it was published in 1991, the first edition of Comparative Ecology of Microorganisms and Macroorganisms was unique in its attempt to clearly compare fundamental ecology across the gamut of size. The explosion of molecular biology and the application of its techniques to microbiology and organismal biology have particularly demonstrated the need for interdisciplinary understanding. This updated and expanded edition remains unique. It treats the same topics at greater depth and includes an exhaustive compilation of both the most recent relevant literature in microbial ecology and plant/animal ecology, as well as the early research papers that shaped the concepts and theories discussed. Among the completely updated topics in the book are phylogenetic systematics, search algorithms and optimal foraging theory, comparative metabolism, the origins of life and evolution of multicellularity, and the evolution of life cycles.From Reviews of the First Edition: "John Andrews has succeeded admirably in building a bridge that is accessible to all ecologists." -Ecology "I recommend this book to all ecologists. It is a thoughtful attempt to integrate ideas from, and develop common themes for, two fields of ecology that should not have become fragmented." -American Scientist "Such a synthesis is long past due, and it is shameful that ecologists (both big and little) have been so parochial." -The Quarterly Review of Biology},

In this paper, I outline a new general class of local indicators of spatial association (LISA) and show how they allow for the decomposition of global indicators, such as Moran's I, into the contribution of each observation. The LISA statistics serve two purposes. On one hand, they may be interpreted as indicators of local pockets of nonstationarity, or hot spots, similar to the Gi and G*i statistics of Getis and Ord (1992). On the other hand, they may be used to assess the influence of individual locations on the magnitude of the global statistic and to identify ``outliers,'' as in Anselin's Moran scatterplot (1993a). An initial evaluation of the properties of a LISA statistic is carried out for the local Moran, which is applied in a study of the spatial pattern of conflict for African countries and in a number of Monte Carlo simulations.},

  abstract = {Long-distance dispersal (LDD) outside a species' breeding range contributes to genetic divergence. Previous phylogeographic studies of migratory bird species have not discriminated LDD from vicariant speciation in their diversification process. We conducted an integrative phylogeographic approach to test the LDD hypothesis, which predicts that a Japanese migratory bird subspecies diverged from a population in the coastal region of the East China Sea (CRECS) via LDD over the East China Sea (ECS). Haplotype networks of both mitochondrial and nuclear genes of its three subspecies were reconstructed to examine whether the Japanese subspecies of the Brown Shrike (Lanius cristatus superciliosus) diverged from an ancestral CRECS population. A species distribution model (SDM) for the Japanese subspecies was constructed using bioclimatic variables under the maximum entropy algorithm. It was projected backwards to the climate of the last glacial maximum (LGM) to infer the candidate source area of colonization. A migratory route of L. c. superciliosus, which possibly reflects a candidate past colonization route, was tracked by light-level geolocators. Molecular phylogenetic networks suggest that the Japanese subspecies diverged from a population in the CRECS and maintained anciently diverged haplotypes. The SDM inferred that the emerged continental shelf of the ECS and the present CRECS were suitable breeding areas for the Japanese subspecies during the LGM. A major migratory route for L. c. superciliosus was inferred between the CRECS and the Japanese archipelago across the ECS. Our integrative approach supported the LDD hypothesis for divergence of the Japanese subspecies of the Brown Shrike. Shrinkage of the ECS may have been responsible for successful population establishment, due to a sufficient number of migrants overshooting to the Japanese archipelago from the CRECS. Our framework provides a new phylogeographic scenario for this region. Discriminating LDD and vicariance models helps improve our understanding of the phylogeographic histories of migratory species.},

  abstract = {Aim An intensively debated issue in macroecology is whether unicellular organisms show biogeographic patterns different from those of macroorganisms. One aspect of this debate addresses beta diversity, that is, do microbial organisms exhibit distance-decay patterns similar to those of macroorganisms? And if so, is the decay of community similarity caused by spatially limited dispersal or by niche-related factors? We studied the community similarity of stream diatoms, macroinvertebrates and bryophytes across the same set of sites in relation to environmental and geographic distance. Location A geographical gradient of c. 1100 km in Finland. Methods We first identified the subset of environmental variables that produced the highest correlation with community similarities for each taxonomic group. Based on these variables, we used partial Mantel tests to separate the independent influences of environmental and geographical distance for distance decay of community similarity, separately for diatoms, bryophytes and macroinvertebrates. Finally, macroinvertebrates were divided into three groups based on their different dispersal categories and a partial Mantel test was used to assess whether each of these groups were differently affected by environmental versus geographic distance, i.e. is dispersal a key factor in tests of niche versus neutral models. Results The level of environmental control was by far the strongest for diatoms; however, all groups were controlled more by environmental factors than by limited dispersal. Macroinvertebrate species with low dispersal ability were significantly related to geographic distance, while more effective dispersers showed no relationship to geography but were instead strongly related to environmental distance. Main conclusions Our results suggest that patterns between macro- and microorganisms are not fundamentally different, but the level of environmental control varies according to dispersal ability. The relative importance of niche versus dispersal processes is not simply a function of organism size but other traits (e.g. life-history type, dispersal capacity) may obscure this relationship.},

Fat accumulation is associated with a seasonal shift in food selection, an increase in premigratory daily food intake, and an increase in utilization efficiency of ingested food. Seasonal frugivory is the most striking seasonal change in diet composition of many migrants. The adaptive role of seasonal facultative frugivory has only rarely been investigated. Fruits seem to provide a particular nutritional quality, namely fatty acids, which promote the accumulation of premigratory fat of a particular quality. Moreover, plant secondary compounds seem to play a role in migratory fat accumulation, and there is evidence that several plant allelochemicals that are consumed with the fruits increase appetite and stimulate tissue anabolism. The nutritional mechanisms, however, are as yet unknown.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Capsule Routes and destinations have been unveiled but modern techniques offer the chance to explore much more. Ringing of birds unveiled many mysteries of avian migrations, notably routes and destinations. However, there is still much to be explored by the use of ringing and other marks. Satellite tracking, geolocation and global positioning systems, and even electronic tags may enable much more detailed insights into the migration patterns of individual birds and populations. But also a more elaborated colour-marking approach is recommended. Moreover, particular chemical and molecular markers appear to be very useful in the study of bird migration by delineating the origin of birds and connectivity between breeding and non-breeding grounds. Co-ordinated, collaborative, standardized and large-scale migration networks provide another elaborate tool to study differential migration and patterns of migratory timing and fuelling. Although our understanding of bird migration has gained much from captive studies about the internal mechanisms in the control of bird migration, we still lack knowledge about external factors, such as food availability, weather, competitors, parasites or diseases. Such data are also required to refine theoretical models of migration strategies. Future migration research must aim at much more comparative research and a more integrative approach at various spatial and temporal scales, and link various subdisciplines. It must also consider that migration is only one part of the life of a migrating species. Thus, linking migration and breeding is another future challenge, both for basic science and for effective protection of migratory birds.},

In this paper we present results from an interdisciplinary graduate-level seminar class focused on this topic. Through the medium of case studies in global change ecology (soil respiration, nitrogen cycling, plant species invasion and land use/cover change) we highlight differences in our respective approach to ecology and give examples where disciplinary perspective influences our interpretation of the system under study.

Our impression of this literature is that referenced statements tend to cite the same papers in support of a small set of ideas, and often there is a mismatch between what papers contain and what they're cited for. Motivated by these impressions, we built and quantitatively examined a database of referenced statements about nuclearity in flocks. This confirmed our impression quantitatively, but more strikingly, a single paper stood out in its influence on ideas around nuclearity in flocks. Moynihan's 1962 monograph on mixed-species flocks in Panama, `The organization and probable evolution of some mixed-species flocks of neotropical birds' published in Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, was cited twice as much as the next most-cited paper and was the most-cited paper for 10 out of 15 most-discussed ideas related to nuclearity. Further, a number of other highly cited papers are strongly influenced by Moynihan's ideas, i.e. its influence is much greater than what a count of citations conveys. We also found that Moynihan was mis-cited frequently. We juxtapose what we found from the citation analysis with what the paper actually contains to better understand the nature of support that Moynihan provides, and discuss the implications of our findings for what we know about and how we research nuclearity in flocks.

In mosaic landscapes, bird functional diversity is considered to be an important driver of avian insectivory, but depends on forest fragmentation and edge effects from adjacent, non-forest habitats. In a transcontinental experiment, we investigated edge and landscape effects on bird functional diversity and insectivory in mosaic landscapes of mixed forests and open habitats. Location New Zealand and France. Methods We paired edge and interior plots in native forest fragments in New Zealand and native plantation forests in France. We sampled bird communities using point-counts and linear transects respectively and simultaneously quantified avian insectivory as the rate of bird attacks on plasticine models mimicking tree-feeding Lepidoptera larvae. The same seven life traits and attributes were compiled for French and New Zealand birds, including biogeographic origin, body mass, mobility, foraging method, adult diet, nest location and clutch size. Bird functional diversity was quantified on this multitrait basis by four indices: functional richness, evenness, divergence and dispersion. We used mixed models to test for the effects of forest edges, study area, surrounding landscape diversity and native forest cover on bird functional diversity and insectivory. Results We found higher bird functional richness at forest edges than interiors in New Zealand and lower functional richness at edges in France. However, bird functional evenness and divergence were significantly higher at forest edges in the two countries. Functional evenness and dispersion both increased with landscape diversity and evenness increased with native forest cover. Moreover, bird insectivory increased at forest edges with functional evenness, irrespective of the study area. Main conclusions We suggest that intermediate levels of forest fragmentation and edge effects increase avian insectivory in mosaic landscapes, through enhanced functional evenness and trait complementation within predatory bird assemblages.},

We also experimentally measured with plasticine models how forest fragment area and edge versus interior location influenced the intensity of avian insectivory. Bird assemblages were sampled by conducting 15~min point-counts at paired edge and interior plots in 13 forest fragments of increasing size (0.5\textendash 141~ha). Avian insectivory was measured as the rate of insectivorous bird attacks on plasticine models mimicking larvae of a native polyphagous moth. We found significant effects of edge, but not of forest patch area, on species richness, abundance and composition of bird assemblages. Exotic birds were more abundant at forest edges, while neither edge nor area effects were noticeable for native bird richness and abundance. Model predation rates increased with forest fragmentation, both because of higher insectivory in smaller forest patches and at forest edges. Avian predation significantly increased with insectivorous bird richness and foraging bird abundance. We suggest that the coexistence of native and exotic birds in New Zealand mosaic landscapes enhances functional diversity and trait complementation within predatory bird assemblages. This coexistence results in increased avian insectivory in small forest fragments through additive edge and area effects.},

Light has strong effects on leaf quality, so the impacts of herbivores and predators may differ between plants grown in sun and shade. However, past experiments have often been unable to separate the effects of light environment on plant traits and herbivory from direct effects on herbivores and predators. We first manipulated light availability in an open habitat using a shade cloth pre-treatment to produce oak saplings with different leaf qualities. Leaves on plants exposed to high light were thicker and tougher and had lower nitrogen and water contents, and higher carbon and phenolic contents than leaves on plants under a shade cloth. Then, in the main experiment, we moved all plants to a common shade environment where bird predators were excluded in a factorial design. We measured insect herbivore abundance and leaf damage. Herbivores were significantly more abundant and caused greater leaf damage on sun trees, although these leaf characteristics are usually associated with low-quality food. Bird exclusion did not change herbivore abundance but did increase leaf damage. Contrary to our predictions, the effects of birds did not differ between trees grown in sun and shade conditions. Thus, differences in effects of predators on herbivores and plants between light habitats, when observed, might be due to variation in predator abundance and not bottom-up effects of host plant quality.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Top-down effects of predators can have important consequences for ecosystems. Insectivorous birds frequently have strong predation effects on herbivores and other arthropods, as well as indirect effects on herbivores' host plants. Diet studies have shown that birds in temperate ecosystems consume arthropods in winter as well as in summer, but experimental studies of bird predation effects have not attempted to quantitatively separate winter predation impacts from those in summer. To understand if winter foraging by insectivorous birds has consequences for arthropods or plants, we performed a meta-analysis of published bird exclusion studies in temperate forest and shrubland habitats. We categorized 85 studies from 41 publications by whether birds were excluded year-round or only in summer, and analyzed arthropod and plant response variables. We also performed a manipulative field experiment in which we used a factorial design to exclude birds from \emph{Quercus velutina} Lam. saplings in winter and summer, and censused arthropods and herbivore damage in the following growing season. In the meta-analysis, birds had stronger negative effects on herbivores in studies that included winter exclusion, and this effect was not due to study duration. However, this greater predation effect did not translate to a greater impact on plant damage or growth. In the field experiment, winter exclusion did not influence herbivore abundance or their impacts on plants. We have shown that winter feeding by temperate insectivorous birds can have important consequences for insect herbivore populations, but the strength of these effects may vary considerably among ecosystems. A full understanding of the ecological roles of insectivorous birds will require explicit consideration of their foraging in the non-growing season, and we make recommendations for how future studies can address this.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We found significant trends in the daily number of observations in all three countries, indicating a surge in urban observation during lockdowns. We found an increase in the mean daily number of urban observations during the lockdown in Italy and Spain, compared to previous years. The mean daily number of non-urban observations decreased in Italy and Spain, while remained similar to previous years in the UK. We found a general decrease of new records during the lockdowns both in urban and non-urban areas in all countries. Our results suggest that the citizen science community remained active during the lockdowns and kept reporting birds from home. However, limitations to movements may have hampered the possibility of birdwatchers to explore natural areas and collect new records.

  abstract = {Efforts to curtail the spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) have led to the unprecedented concurrent confinement of nearly two-thirds of the global population. The large human lockdown and its eventual relaxation can be viewed as a Global Human Confinement Experiment. This experiment is a unique opportunity to identify positive and negative effects of human presence and mobility on a range of natural systems, including wildlife, and protected areas, and to study processes regulating biodiversity and ecosystems. We encourage ecologists, environmental scientists, and resource managers to contribute their observations to efforts aiming to build comprehensive global understanding based on multiple data streams, including anecdotal observations, systematic assessments and quantitative monitoring. We argue that the collective power of combining diverse data will transcend the limited value of the individual data sets and produce unexpected insights. We can also consider the confinement experiment as a ``stress test'' to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses in the adequacy of existing networks to detect human impacts on natural systems. Doing so will provide evidence for the value of the conservation strategies that are presently in place, and create future networks, observatories and policies that are more adept in protecting biological diversity across the world.},

  abstract = {The global lockdown to mitigate COVID-19 pandemic health risks has altered human interactions with nature. Here, we report immediate impacts of changes in human activities on wildlife and environmental threats during the early lockdown months of 2020, based on 877 qualitative reports and 332 quantitative assessments from 89 different studies. Hundreds of reports of unusual species observations from around the world suggest that animals quickly responded to the reductions in human presence. However, negative effects of lockdown on conservation also emerged, as confinement resulted in some park officials being unable to perform conservation, restoration and enforcement tasks, resulting in local increases in illegal activities such as hunting. Overall, there is a complex mixture of positive and negative effects of the pandemic lockdown on nature, all of which have the potential to lead to cascading responses which in turn impact wildlife and nature conservation. While the net effect of the lockdown will need to be assessed over years as data becomes available and persistent effects emerge, immediate responses were detected across the world. Thus, initial qualitative and quantitative data arising from this serendipitous global quasi-experimental perturbation highlights the dual role that humans play in threatening and protecting species and ecosystems. Pathways to favorably tilt this delicate balance include reducing impacts and increasing conservation effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Aim The forest moss layer plays an important role in water retention, nutrient cycling and forest regeneration. We quantified broad-scale latitudinal patterns and environmental drivers of moss layer cover in extratropical upland forests where such information has been missing. Location One thousand, nine hundred and seventy-seven sites outside the tropical belt (i.e., beyond 26\textdegree{} N and S) across longitudes (from 154\textdegree{} W to 140\textdegree{} E) and elevations (from 0 to 3,950 m a.s.l.). Time period Current (1969\textendash 2016). Major taxa studied Moss layer bryophytes (mosses, liverworts and hornworts). Methods We compiled three large datasets from: (a) a global literature search, (b) a national forest inventory database in the USA and (c) an extensive survey along the Appalachian Trail (Eastern USA) to contrast the moss layer cover along latitudinal gradients and among regions. We used correlation analysis and simple (meta- and linear-) regression to test whether moss layer cover increased towards the poles across and within forest biomes, and we used multiple (meta- and beta-) regression to test whether and how climate, forest composition and age and topography influence forest moss layer cover at broad spatial scales. Results Forest moss cover increased towards the North along a clear latitudinal gradient by c. 2\% per 1\textdegree{} of latitude, and it decreased with increasing maximum temperature by c. 1\%\textendash 5\% per 1\textdegree C. Thus, cool northern regions (e.g., northern Europe) can be considered forest moss layer hotspots. Moss layer cover was driven mainly by canopy composition when all potential drivers were considered. Compared with broad-scale systematic surveys, the data from specialized literature overestimated moss cover in broadleaf deciduous forests where moss cover was low and variable. Main conclusions Our findings highlight that systematic surveys complement specialized literature in accurately modelling abundance on broad scales. Given that temperature, rather than precipitation or seasonality, limited the abundance of forest moss layer on broad scales, the moss layer might be a promising tool for monitoring forest ecosystem responses to climate warming.},

  abstract = {This study investigated the importance of habitat quality and habitat heterogeneity for the abundance and diversity of breeding birds in continuous forest and in forest fragments surrounded by farmland in central Sweden. Positive correlations were found between species number and area, volume of Aspen Populus tremula and habitat heterogeneity. Spatial segregation of habitats at a relatively fine-grained scale is suggested to allow for the co-occurrence of more species. The abundance of at least 18 of the species in this study was influenced by fragmentation, and nine of these species preferred fragments to forest sites. The total density of birds was higher in fragments than in forest sites, probably because several fragment species forage in farmland surrounding the sites and a few also forage at edges. Nine species were more common in forest sites than in fragments, but only one species was restricted to continuous forest. However, several fragments were relatively close to forests (150 m) and forest was common in larger scale contexts. The abundance of most species (25 of 33 species) in this study was correlated with habitat quality variables (i.e. variables measuring the size, volume and diversity of `tree species'). Among these habitat variables the most important was the occurrence of deciduous trees which seemed to be important for 14 species. The second most important habitat factor seemed to be the diameter of trees, which was positively correlated with the abundance of eight species of which five are hole-nesters. Among coniferous trees, six species were positively correlated with the volume of Norway Spruce Picea abies, whereas no species seemed to be correlated with the volume of Pine Pinus sylvestris.},

  abstract = {1. The possible competition for food between the great and blue tit (Parus major and P. caeruleus) in oak woodland, and their relationships with the coal and marsh tit (P. ater and P. palustris), was studied by means of gizzard analyses. There was little similarity in the diets of the great and blue tits, the great tit taking mainly adult insects, especially weevils, while the blue tit fed mainly on scale insects and small larval and pupal forms. The coal tit showed a preference for small free-living insects, and scales. The diet of the marsh tit consisted of adult insects, scales and some larval forms. Spiders formed a small proportion of the diet of all four species. The great and marsh tits fed more on seeds and nuts than did the other species, and oak bud and gall tissue were found in large quantities only in the blue tit. 2. An analysis of the insect food showed that the great tit was largely a ground feeder, except in the breeding season, while the blue tit fed mainly on the oak twigs, buds and leaves. The coal tit showed a preference for insects from trunks and branches, while the marsh tit fed both on the ground and in the canopy. The beaks of the tit-mice were adapted to the size and types of foods taken by the birds, enabling all four species to feed in the same places without necessarily competing for food. 3. Nestling foods of a brood of great tits and a brood of blue tits reflected the differences in the type and size of foods selected by the adults in the rest of the year. Caterpillars were taken by both species, but pupae extracted from curled leaves formed a much greater proportion of the diet of the blue tits than of the great tits. Adult insects, forming 19\% of the great tit nestling food, were not taken for the young by the blue tit. Both species fed spiders, crushed snails and grit to the young. Most of the food items brought to the young blue tits measured under 10 mm, while most of those fed to the great tits measured over this length. 4. Measurements were made of the caterpillar and titmouse populations in a nest-boxed area and an adjoining unboxed control area in 1950 and 1951. The rate of predation by titmice on all defoliating caterpillars in the boxed area was about 1.4\% in 1950, 4.8\% in 1951, while in the control area it was 0.9\% in 1950, 3.2\% in 1951. The proportion of the winter moth (Operophtera brumata) larvae removed by the titmice in the two years in the nest-boxed area was 0.5\% in 1950, 2.6\% in 1951, and in the control area 0.3\% in 1950, 1.7\% in 1951. In both years the caterpillar population was relatively low compared with the 1949 populations. In the winter of 1950-51 it was estimated that the predation rate by titmice on the female winter moths might have been about 20\% in both areas. This predation on the moth population may be affected by climatic conditions, and the abundance of alternative food for the birds.}

  abstract = {To maximize fitness, organisms must assess and select suitable habitat. Early research studying birds suggested that organisms consider primarily vegetation structural cues in their habitat choices. We show that experimental exposure to singing in the post-breeding period provides a social cue that is used for habitat selection the following year by a migrant songbird, the black-throated blue warbler (Dendroica caerulescens). Our experimental social cues coerced individuals to adopt territories in areas of very poor habitat quality where individuals typically do not occur. This indicates that social information can override typical associations with vegetation structure. We demonstrate that a strong settlement response was elicited because post-breeding song at a site is highly correlated with reproductive success. These results constitute a previously undocumented, but highly parsimonious mechanism for the inadvertent transfer of reproductive (public) information from successful breeders to dispersers. We hypothesize that post-breeding song is a pervasive and reliable cue for species that communicate vocally, inhabit temporally autocorrelated environments, produce young asynchronously and/or abandon territories after reproductive failure.},

Nine of 17 species were captured more often (P \&lt; 0.05) in gaps during fall. During spring, flycatchers, ground insectivores, foliage insectivores, and granivore-omnivores were captured more frequently (P \&lt; 0.05) in gaps. Flycatchers showed no difference in fall, but other trophic groups, including frugivores, were captured more frequently (P \&lt; 0.05) in gaps than in forest understory sites. Bark foragers showed no statistical preference for gaps or forest understory in spring or fall. Total species per net and total captures per net correlated positively (P \&lt; 0.05) with density of foliage in the lower canopy and negatively with density of upper canopy foliage in both spring and fall. Total species and captures correlated positively (P \&lt; 0.05) with insect abundance in spring and with fruit abundance in fall. Foliage insectivores correlated positively with low canopy foliage and insect abundance in both spring and fall. Captures of frugivores correlated with fruit abundance in fall.

  abstract = {Replaying the tape of life The evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould once dreamed about replaying the tape of life in order to identify whether evolution is more subject to deterministic or contingent forces. Greater influence of determinism would mean that outcomes are more repeatable and less subject to variations of history. Contingency, on the other hand, suggests that outcomes are contingent on specific events, making them less repeatable. Blount et al. review the numerous studies that have been done since Gould put forward this question, both experimental and observational, and find that many patterns of adaptation are convergent. Nevertheless, there is still much variation with regard to the mechanisms and forms that converge. Science, this issue p. eaam5979 Structured Abstract BACKGROUNDEvolution is a strongly historical process, and evolutionary biology is a field that combines history and science. How the historical nature of evolution affects the predictability of evolutionary outcomes has long been a major question in the field. The power of natural selection to find the limited set of high-fitness solutions to the challenges imposed by environments could, in principle, make those outcomes deterministic. However, the outcomes also may depend on idiosyncratic events that an evolving lineage experiences\textemdash such as the order of appearance of random mutations or rare environmental perturbations\textemdash making evolutionary outcomes unrepeatable. This sensitivity of outcomes to the details of history is called ``historical contingency,'' which Stephen Jay Gould argued was an essential feature of evolution. Gould illustrated this view by proposing the thought experiment of replaying life's tape to see if the living world that we know would re-evolve. But, Gould wrote, ``The bad news is that we can't possibly perform the experiment.''Gould's pessimistic assessment notwithstanding, experimental evolutionary biologists have now performed many replay experiments, albeit on a small scale, while comparative biologists are analyzing evolutionary outcomes in nature as though they were natural replay experiments. These studies provide new examples and insights into the interplay of historical contingency and natural selection that sits at the heart of evolution. ADVANCESBiologists have devised a variety of approaches to study the effects of history on the repeatability of evolutionary outcomes. On the experimental side, several designs have been employed, mostly using microbes, including ``parallel replay experiments,'' in which initially identical populations are followed as they evolve in identical environments, and ``historical difference experiments,'' in which previously diverged populations evolve under identical conditions (see the figure). Our review of many such experiments indicates that responses across replicate populations are often repeatable to some degree, although divergence increases as analyses move from overall fitness to underlying phenotypes and genetic changes. It is common for replicates with similar fitness under the conditions in which they evolved to vary more in their performance in other environments. Idiosyncratic outcomes also occur. For example, aerobic growth on citrate has evolved only once among 12 populations in an experiment with Escherichia coli, even after more than 65,000 generations. In that case, additional replays showed that the trait's evolution was dependent on the prior occurrence of particular mutations.Meanwhile, comparative biologists have cataloged many notable examples of convergent evolution among species living in similar environments, illustrating the power of natural selection to produce similar phenotypic outcomes despite different evolutionary histories. Nonetheless, convergence is not inevitable\textemdash in many cases, lineages adapt phenotypically in different ways to the same environmental conditions. For example, the aye-aye (a lemur) and woodpeckers have evolved different morphological adaptations to similar ecological niches (see the figure). An emerging theme from comparative studies, tentatively supported by replay experiments, is that repeatability is common when the founding populations are closely related, perhaps resulting from shared genetics and developmental pathways, whereas different outcomes become more likely as historical divergences become greater. OUTLOOKGould would be pleased that his thought experiment of replaying life's tape has been transformed into an empirical research program that explores the roles of historical contingency and natural selection at multiple levels. However, his view of historical influences as the central feature of evolution remains debatable. Laboratory replay experiments show that repeatable outcomes are common, at least when defined broadly (e.g., at the level of genes, not mutations). Moreover, convergence in nature is more common than many biologists would have wagered not long ago. On the other hand, as evolving lineages accumulate more differences, both experimental and comparative approaches suggest that the power of selection to drive convergence is reduced, and the contingent effects of history are amplified. Recognizing the joint contributions of contingency and natural selection raises interesting questions for further study, such as how the extent of prior genetic divergence affects the propensity for later convergence. Theory and experiments indicate that the ``adaptive landscape''\textemdash that is, how specific phenotypes, and ultimately fitness, map onto the high dimensionality of genotypic space\textemdash plays a key role in these outcomes. Thus, a better understanding of these mappings will be important for a deeper appreciation of how fate and chance intertwine in the evolutionary pageant. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/362/6415/eaam5979/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Replaying the tape of life.The tape of life is replayed on a small scale in evolution experiments of different designs. (A) In a parallel replay experiment, initially identical replicate populations evolve under the same conditions to see whether evolution is parallel or divergent. (B) A historical difference experiment explores the influence of earlier history in phase 1 on later evolution during phase 2. In nature, diverged lineages exposed to similar environmental conditions are similar to a historical difference experiment, in that the potential for convergence on the same adaptive response may depend on their earlier evolutionary histories. In the case of (C) the woodpecker and (D) the aye-aye, they have adapted to the same ecological niche (locating grubs, excavating through dead wood, and extracting them), but they evolved different anatomical traits to do so, reflecting the legacy of their evolutionary histories (e.g., primates lack beaks, birds lack fingers).ILLUSTRATION: MARLIN PETERSON (PANELS C AND D) Historical processes display some degree of ``contingency,'' meaning their outcomes are sensitive to seemingly inconsequential events that can fundamentally change the future. Contingency is what makes historical outcomes unpredictable. Unlike many other natural phenomena, evolution is a historical process. Evolutionary change is often driven by the deterministic force of natural selection, but natural selection works upon variation that arises unpredictably through time by random mutation, and even beneficial mutations can be lost by chance through genetic drift. Moreover, evolution has taken place within a planetary environment with a particular history of its own. This tension between determinism and contingency makes evolutionary biology a kind of hybrid between science and history. While philosophers of science examine the nuances of contingency, biologists have performed many empirical studies of evolutionary repeatability and contingency. Here, we review the experimental and comparative evidence from these studies. Replicate populations in evolutionary ``replay'' experiments often show parallel changes, especially in overall performance, although idiosyncratic outcomes show that the particulars of a lineage's history can affect which of several evolutionary paths is taken. Comparative biologists have found many notable examples of convergent adaptation to similar conditions, but quantification of how frequently such convergence occurs is difficult. On balance, the evidence indicates that evolution tends to be surprisingly repeatable among closely related lineages, but disparate outcomes become more likely as the footprint of history grows deeper. Ongoing research on the structure of adaptive landscapes is providing additional insight into the interplay of fate and chance in the evolutionary process.},

Since the 1960s, prey species with diverse phenotypes have been viewed as the evolved reflection of the perceptual and cognitive characteristics of their predators. Because it is harder to search simultaneously for two or more cryptic prey types than to search for only one, visual predators should tend to focus on the most abundant forms and effectively overlook the others. The result should be frequency-dependent, apostatic selection, which will tend to stabilize the prey polymorphism. Validating this elegant hypothesis has been difficult, and many details have been established only relatively recently. This review clarifies the argument for a perceptual selective mechanism and examines the relevant experimental evidence.},

  abstract = {Habitat loss and fragmentation are key drivers of biodiversity loss. However, they are usually confounded, making it difficult to separate fragmentation effects from those of habitat loss. In addition, it has been shown that often fragmentation negatively affects biodiversity only below a certain threshold of habitat amount. We investigated the separate and interactive effects of habitat amount and fragmentation on habitat selection of the woodlark at 10 spatial scales. In southern Switzerland this passerine mainly breeds in ground-vegetated vineyards, which therefore represent the focal habitat type in this study. Additionally, we investigated land cover, topographic and climatic variables at the same 10 scales to obtain a holistic picture of species-habitat associations. Habitat selection was analyzed at two hierarchical levels: home range selection within the study area and habitat use within home ranges. Home range selection was strongly driven by an interactive effect of habitat amount and fragmentation: woodlarks avoided fragmented areas if habitat amount was below 20\% but exhibited a preference for fragmented areas if habitat amount exceeded this threshold. Both habitat amount and fragmentation most strongly affected habitat use at the 100 m scale. We did not find such interactive effects for habitat use within home ranges. At this level, habitat amount at a 50 m scale influenced woodlark presence positively with no significant effects of fragmentation. Furthermore, woodlarks preferred evenly sloped landscape mosaics interspersed with steppes and groves. Two main insights emerge from our study. First, these results highlight the necessity of studying scale explicit and interactive effects of habitat amount and fragmentation when addressing ecological questions, such as habitat selection in birds. Second, we provide management recommendations for farmers: more vineyards should be vegetated and arranged as disjunct patches where their surface covers more than 20\% of the landscape but be aggregated where vegetated area is lower.},

We investigated seasonal differences in bird use of gap and forest habitat within a bottomland hardwood forest in the Upper Coastal Plain of South Carolina. Gaps were 0.13- to 0.5-ha, 7- to 8-year-old group-selection timber harvest openings. Our study occurred during four bird-use periods (spring migration, breeding, postbreeding, and fall migration) in 2001 and 2002. We used plot counts and mist netting to estimate bird abundance in canopy gaps and surrounding mature forest habitats. Using both survey methods, we observed more birds, including forest-interior species, forest-edge species, field-edge species, and several individual species in canopy gap and gap-edge habitats than in surrounding mature forest during all periods. Interactions between period and habitat type often were significant in models, suggesting a seasonal shift in habitat use. Bird activity generally shifted between the interior of canopy gaps and the immediate gap edge, but many species increased their use of forested habitat during the breeding period. This suggests that many species of birds selectively choose gap and gap-edge habitat over surrounding mature forest during the non-breeding period. Creation of small canopy gaps within a mature forest may increase local bird species richness. The reasons for increased bird activity in gaps remain unclear.},

  abstract = {This study explores how researchers' analytical choices affect the reliability of scientific findings. Most discussions of reliability problems in science focus on systematic biases. We broaden the lens to emphasize the idiosyncrasy of conscious and unconscious decisions that researchers make during data analysis. We coordinated 161 researchers in 73 research teams and observed their research decisions as they used the same data to independently test the same prominent social science hypothesis: that greater immigration reduces support for social policies among the public. In this typical case of social science research, research teams reported both widely diverging numerical findings and substantive conclusions despite identical start conditions. Researchers' expertise, prior beliefs, and expectations barely predict the wide variation in research outcomes. More than 95\% of the total variance in numerical results remains unexplained even after qualitative coding of all identifiable decisions in each team's workflow. This reveals a universe of uncertainty that remains hidden when considering a single study in isolation. The idiosyncratic nature of how researchers' results and conclusions varied is a previously underappreciated explanation for why many scientific hypotheses remain contested. These results call for greater epistemic humility and clarity in reporting scientific findings.},

Food preference - expressed in relation to availability - is estimated for 22 arthropod taxa (families and orders). Uni- and multivariate statistics detected no relations between food preference and nutrient contents, but revealed that larger prey items are fed to nestlings more than smaller ones, both for all prey taken together and within individual taxa. Also, slowly flying arthropods, which are easier to catch, were usually preferred over walking and fast flying ones. Combined with results from previous studies on the effects of vegetation, prey density and catchability on search times and energy intake, these findings suggest that water pipits select their prey primarily in order to maximize profitability, i.e. energy intake per unit time. Qualitative traits seem to be important only in specific taxa. For instance, toxins or poor digestibility may be responsible for avoiding heteropterans, beetles and ants and for feeding the nestlings fewer tipulids than expected at high tipulid densities.},

Aims To evaluate differences in food distribution between forest edges and forest interiors and their effects on the non-breeding flocking patterns of Coal Tit populations inhabiting mountain coniferous forests. Methods We collected cone production data at forests edges and interiors in mountain pine forests located in the Pyrenees (northeast Iberian peninsula). At the same sites, we also quantified Coal Tit abundance, flocking patterns and foraging behaviour by means of paired bird surveys during autumn and early winter. Results We recorded a larger abundance of pine cones available on trees along forest edges compared with forest interiors. Coal Tit groups were of bigger size along forest edges, although the number of social groups detected did not differ from forest interiors. Our observations on foraging behaviour supported the hypothesis that differences in flock sizes and overall abundances associated with distance to the edge are due to differences in the availability of pine cones and to the heavier use of these foraging substrates by birds along forest edges. Conclusions Our results suggest that by changing food distribution, edge effects on pine cone production may be significantly involved in local changes in the social structure of the Coal Tit. An increase in resource heterogeneity and local population density may have important implications at a population level, such as favouring mobility of individuals searching for food resources and thus a transient life, and increasing the costs of territory defence to resident individuals.},

  abstract = {Humans have marvelled at the fit of form and function, the way organisms' traits seem remarkably suited to their lifestyles and ecologies. While natural selection provides the scientific basis for the fit of form and function, Darwin found certain adaptations vexing or particularly intriguing: sex ratios, sexual selection and altruism. The logic behind these adaptations resides in frequency-dependent selection where the value of a given heritable phenotype (i.e. strategy) to an individual depends upon the strategies of others. Game theory is a branch of mathematics that is uniquely suited to solving such puzzles. While game theoretic thinking enters into Darwin's arguments and those of evolutionists through much of the twentieth century, the tools of evolutionary game theory were not available to Darwin or most evolutionists until the 1970s, and its full scope has only unfolded in the last three decades. As a consequence, game theory is applied and appreciated rather spottily. Game theory not only applies to matrix games and social games, it also applies to speciation, macroevolution and perhaps even to cancer. I assert that life and natural selection are a game, and that game theory is the appropriate logic for framing and understanding adaptations. Its scope can include behaviours within species, state-dependent strategies (such as male, female and so much more), speciation and coevolution, and expands beyond microevolution to macroevolution. Game theory clarifies aspects of ecological and evolutionary stability in ways useful to understanding eco-evolutionary dynamics, niche construction and ecosystem engineering. In short, I would like to think that Darwin would have found game theory uniquely useful for his theory of natural selection. Let us see why this is so.},

The density and pairing success of territorial males increased significantly with area of the woodlot core. We tested the hypotheses that area-related changes in food abundance and the availability of suitable nest sites are the causal mechanisms limiting female settlement in small forest fragments. Our results indicated that Ovenbirds chose territories with signifi\- cantly higher prey biomass than occurred at randomly selected sites in the woodlot. Within Ovenbird territories, prey biomass was 10 to 36 times higher in large woodlots than in small woodlots. Invertebrate biomass at randomly located quadrats in large woodlots was more than twice that found at random sites within small woodlots, and was slightly greater than prey biomass within Ovenbird territories in small fragments. Leaf litter was deeper within Ovenbird territories in large woodlots than at random sites in both large and small forests, and within Ovenbird territories in small woodlots. Ovenbirds in large woodlots selected nest sites that were more than 250 m from the forest edge, distances that were not obtainable in small forest fragments. The lack of potential nest sites, combined with lower food abundance in small fragments, may explain why female Ovenbirds find small fragments unsuitable as breeding sites, and hence why so few males secure mates in small fragments. Understanding the cause of deterioration of breeding sites with decreasing woodlot area should underscore efforts to preserve larger tracts of forest to provide adequate nesting habitat for forest-in\- terior migrants.},

Results showed the presence of 23 Odonata species on 23 ponds. A Mantel test showed that the matrices of pond to pond topographic distances and that of pond to pond faunistic similarity were independent, which supports the hypothesis that the adult Odonata actively choose their breeding site. A stepwise multiple regression showed that only pond size, minimum water level and riparian vegetation had significant effects (all positive) on the total number of Odonata species in each pond. On the other hand, a canonical correspondence analysis showed that the composition of Odonata species assemblages was sensitive to almost all variables. From the point of view of Odonata conservation, both the moderate effect of Gambusia holbrooki and the positive effect of the riparian vegetation on the number of Odonata species appear particularly interesting for restoring or creating Odonata habitats.},

  abstract = {Partial migration, where populations of animals are composed of a mixture of resident and migratory individuals, is a widespread phenomenon in nature. It has been reported to occur in all major vertebrate groups, and can have significant ecological consequences. Here we give an overview of the ecology and evolution of partial migration in animals. We firstly review the different types of partial migration, and assess the ecological drivers responsible for driving individual differences in migratory tendency within populations. A variety of factors can be important in promoting the evolution of partial migration, including competition for resources or breeding opportunities, predation risk and intraspecific niche diversity. Often various factors act synergistically to create complex patterns of movement polymorphism within populations. The question of how partial migration is maintained over evolutionary timescales is also addressed. Whilst many theoretical considerations of partial migration utilise an evolutionary stable state (ESS) paradigm, empirical evidence for this is lacking. Rather the evidence suggests that partial migration is mostly condition dependent, and the optimum outcome for an individual is dependent upon its phenotype. What determines whether an individual follows a migratory or resident strategy is discussed in light of new theory and empirical data which supports the idea that environmentally responsive genetic thresholds are important across a range of species, from birds to fish, in proximately shaping migratory tendency. Finally we espouse our vision of how partial migration research will develop in the future, and suggest a number of exciting directions that studies into migratory dimorphism may take in the coming years.},

For each land use type, bird composition, diversity, and abundance were recorded for 2 years in \%99 plots in three sampling units (each \%4500 ha). A habitat gradient defined by canopy structure (grasslands to savannas to forests) was influenced by land use, so \%300 plots were used to characterize simultaneous variation in bird communities along land use and habitat gradients. At broad scales (aggregate of 33 plots covering \%4500 ha) suburbs supported the lowest bird richness and diversity and rural landscapes the most, with reserves slightly below rural. Although reserves were like rural lands in diversity of bird communities, they supported more species of conservation concern, particularly of grasslands and savannas. Differences among land use types varied with habitat structure. Suburbs, rural lands, and reserves had similar forest bird communities, but differed in grassland and savanna bird communities. The extensive rural forests are important for the region's forest birds. Suburban grasslands and savannas had low shrub abundance, low native bird richness and high non-native bird richness and abundance. However, total bird richness and diversity were as high in suburban as in rural and reserve plots because high native richness in suburban forests and high non-native species richness in suburban grasslands and savannas compensated for lower native richness in suburban grasslands and savannas. Bird conservation here and in the Midwest USA should protect rural forests, expand grasslands and savannas in reserves, and improve habitat quality overall.},

  abstract = {Dragonflies are reliable indicators of the ecological quality of land \textendash{} water ecotones, habitat heterogeneity and the hydrological dynamics of water bodies. In recent years, surveys of dragonfly communities have become a powerful tool for the ecological assessment of floodplain areas. The goal of this paper is to present a new approach towards assessing the ecological integrity of river\textendash floodplain systems by analysing resident breeding dragonfly species. The methodology is based on experiences with existing approaches using macroinvertebrates as bioindicators, in particular, calculations of saprobic indices, longitudinal zonation and functional feeding group patterns. In addition to the total number of species and the number of sensitive species, the `Odonate Habitat Index' (OHI) is a key element of the assessment method. It indicates characteristic features of a river \textendash{} floodplain system, such as connectivity aspects, flow dynamics and terrestrialization processes. The OHI is calculated from the species-specific habitat values (expressing habitat preferences), abundances and the species-specific indication weight, which distinguishes eurytopic from stenotopic species. The comparison of the status quo with a reference condition allows an assessment of individual water bodies and/or of a whole area in a five-tiered classification scheme. The approach presented may also be used for the evaluation of restoration measures (e.g. reconnection of side arms) and for the definition of management objectives. Apart from the methodological framework, the results of a first application of this approach are presented in the paper as well. The study areas were selected floodplain systems of the Austrian section of the Danube and man-made inshore structures of the impounded Danube section in Vienna.

During stopovers, birds concentrated close to the coast during spring and inland in forested landscapes during autumn, suggesting seasonal differences in habitat function and highlighting the vital role of stopover habitats in sustaining migratory communities.

The study was conducted in a mixed agricultural and forested landscape in southern Costa Rica from March through August of 2001 and 2002. A transmitter was attached to one fledgling per brood (n = 53). Each bird was located daily prior to dispersal. We compared survivorship, habitat use, and movements of fledglings from (1) nests in coffee plantations and (2) nests in cattle pastures. The probability of surviving the first three weeks out of the nest was 0.67 {$\pm$} 0.07 (SE) for fledglings from nests in all habitats, 0.58 {$\pm$} 0.10 for fledglings from nests in coffee, and 0.74 {$\pm$} 0.26 for fledglings from nests in pasture. Fledglings from nests in pasture left their nesting habitat at younger ages than did those from nests in coffee, and most birds from both habitats moved into forest when they left their nesting habitat. Pasture was rarely used during the postfledging period, whereas coffee plantations were used extensively. Fledglings that remained in agricultural habitats (coffee or pasture) were less likely to survive until dispersal than were those that moved into forested areas. Average daily distances from the nest gradually increased until fledglings dispersed away from the natal area, always into forest, and were not different for birds from pasture or coffee. White-throated Robins can nest successfully in agricultural habitats, but use of forest positively influenced survivorship of young during the postfledging dependent period.},

  abstract = {Recent decades have seen a major surge in the study of interspecific variation in functional traits in comparative plant ecology, as a tool to understanding and predicting ecosystem functions and their responses to environmental change. However, this research has been biased almost exclusively towards vascular plants. Very little is known about the role and applicability of functional traits of non-vascular cryptogams, particularly bryophytes and lichens, with respect to biogeochemical cycling. Yet these organisms are paramount determinants of biogeochemistry in several biomes, particularly cold biomes and tropical rainforests, where they: (1) contribute substantially to above-ground biomass (lichens, bryophytes); (2) host nitrogen-fixing bacteria, providing major soil N input (lichens, bryophytes); (3) control soil chemistry and nutrition through the accumulation of recalcitrant polyphenols (bryophytes) and through their control over soil and vegetation hydrology and temperatures; (4) both promote erosion (rock weathering by lichens) and prevent it (biological crusts in deserts); (5) provide a staple food to mammals such as reindeer (lichens) and arthropodes, with important feedbacks to soils and biota; and (6) both facilitate and compete with vascular plants.Here we review current knowledge about interspecific variation in cryptogam traits with respect to biogeochemical cycling and discuss to what extent traits and measuring protocols needed for bryophytes and lichens correspond with those applied to vascular plants. We also propose and discuss several new or recently introduced traits that may help us understand and predict the control of cryptogams over several aspects of the biogeochemistry of ecosystems.Whilst many methodological challenges lie ahead, comparative cryptogam ecology has the potential to meet some of the important challenges of understanding and predicting the biogeochemical and climate consequences of large-scale environmental changes driving shifts in the cryptogam components of vegetation composition.},

Community assembly theory, and metacommunity theory in particular, provides a framework for understanding the ecological dynamics of the human microbiome, such as compositional variability within and between hosts. We explore three core scenarios of human microbiome assembly: development in infants, representing assembly in previously unoccupied habitats; recovery from antibiotics, representing assembly after disturbance; and invasion by pathogens, representing assembly in the context of invasive species. Judicious application of ecological theory may lead to improved strategies for restoring and maintaining the microbiota and the crucial health-associated ecosystem services that it provides.},

Further, there was a widespread increase in observations originating from urban areas, particularly in iNaturalist and eBird.

  abstract = {In the last few million years, tropical Africa has experienced pronounced climatic shifts with progressive aridification. Such changes must have had a great impact on freshwater biota, such as Odonata. With about forty species, Trithemis dominates dragonfly communities across Africa, from rain-pools to streams, deserts to rainforests, and lowlands to highlands. Red-bodied species tend to favor exposed, standing and often temporary waters, have strong dispersal capacities, and some of the largest geographic ranges in the genus. Those in cooler habitats, like forest streams, are generally dark-bodied and more sedentary. We combined molecular analyses of ND1, 16S, and ITS (ITSI, 5.8S, and ITSII) with morphological, ecological, and geographical data for 81\% of known Trithemis species, including three Asian and two Madagascan endemics. Using molecular clock analyses, the genus's origin was estimated 6\textendash 9 Mya, with multiple lineages arising suddenly around 4 Mya. Open stagnant habitats were inferred to be ancestral and the rise of Trithemis may have coincided with savannah-expansion in the late Miocene. The adaptation of red species to more ephemeral conditions leads to large ranges and limited radiation within those lineages. By contrast, three clades of dark species radiated in the Plio-Pleistocene, each within distinct ecological confines: (1) lowland streams, (2) highland streams, and (3) swampy habitats on alternating sides of the Congo-Zambezi watershed divide; together giving rise to the majority of species diversity in the genus. During Trithemis evolution, multiple shifts from open to more forested habitats and from standing to running waters occurred. Allopatry by habitat fragmentation may be the dominant force in speciation, but possibly genetic divergence across habitat gradients was also involved. The study demonstrates the importance of combining ecological and phylogenetic data to understand the origin of biological diversity under great environmental change.},

  abstract = {Habitat selection is a crucial process in the life cycle of animals because it can affect most components of fitness. It has been proposed that some animals cue on the reproductive success of conspecifics to select breeding habitats. We tested this hypothesis with demographic and behavioral data from a 17-yr study of the Black-legged Kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), a cliff-nesting seabird. As the hypothesis assumes, the Black-legged Kittiwake nesting environment was patchy, and the relative quality of the different patches (i.e., breeding cliffs) varied in time. The average reproductive success of the breeders of a given cliff was predictable from one year to the next, but this predictability faded after several years. The dynamic nature of cliff quality in the long term is partly explained by the autocorrelation of the prevalence of an ectoparasite that influences reproductive success. As predicted by the performance-based conspecific attraction hypothesis, the reproductive success of current breeders on a given cliff was predictive of the reproductive success of new recruits on the cliff in the following year. Breeders tended to recruit to the previous year's most productive cliffs and to emigrate from the least productive ones. Consequently, the dynamics of breeder numbers on the cliffs were explained by local reproductive success on a year-to-year basis. Because, on average, young Black-legged Kittiwakes first breed when 4 yr old, such a relationship probably results from individual choices based on the assessment of previous-year local quality. When breeders changed breeding cliffs between years, they selected cliffs of per capita higher reproductive success. Furthermore, after accounting for the potential effects of age and sex as well as between-year variations, the effect of individual breeding performance on breeding dispersal was strongly influenced by the average reproductive success of other breeders on the same cliff. Individual breeding performance did not appear to influence the probability of dispersing for birds breeding on cliffs with high local reproductive success, whereas individual breeding performance did have a strong effect on dispersal for birds that bred on cliffs with lower local reproductive success. This suggests that the reproductive success of locally breeding conspecifics may be sufficient to override an individual's own breeding experience when deciding whether to emigrate. These results, which are supported by behavioral observations of the role of prospecting in recruitment, suggest that both first breeders and adults rely on the reproductive success of conspecifics as ``public information'' to assess their own chances of breeding successfully in a given patch and to make settling decisions. A corollary prediction is that individuals should attempt to breed near successful conspecifics (a form of social attraction) in order to benefit from the same favorable local environmental conditions. Such a performance-based conspecific attraction mechanism can thus lead to an aggregative distribution of nests and may have played a role in the evolution of coloniality.},

  abstract = {Odonate species are classified in terms of their thermoregulatory behavior into flier and percher categories. Larger perchers could be more efficient thermoregulators in sunny sites and smaller perchers depend more on air temperature. In this paper, an analysis of the behavioral temporal budget of an odonate neotropical assemblage was performed to determine the role of body size on territorial defense and general behavioral strategies. This analysis revealed three groups based on time budget. The first and second groups contained the species that remained perched for most of the activity time, but species of the first group differ from the second group by the larger proportion of transition flights. The third group contained species which were usually observed patrolling or in reproductive activities. The larger species spent more time in patrol and territorial defense activities, while smaller species remained perched. Larger dragonflies, with better thermoregulatory abilities could spend more time in reproductive activities. The behavioral classification of fliers and perchers is considered extremely useful but could oversimplify the behavioral patterns among species that have a wide body size variation. It is proposed that a behavioral continuum associated with the body size variation in perchers could explain some patterns of species interactions in odonate communities.},

We studied 891 spatial replicates from the French Breeding Bird Survey (FBBS) monitored at least two years during 2001\textendash 2005, and two independent landscape databases measuring respectively landscape fragmentation and recent landscape disturbance on each FBBS replicate. We used a continuous habitat specialization index for the 105 most common bird species monitored by the FBBS. We further modelled the spatial variation in abundance of each species according to fragmentation and disturbance across FBBS replicates, accounting for habitat differences and spatial trends. We then tested whether more or less specialized species responded to landscape fragmentation and disturbance. We found that the more specialist a species, the more negative its spatial response to landscape fragmentation and disturbance. Although there was a very high variation around these tendencies indicating that there are many other drivers of species distribution, our results suggest that measuring specialization may be helpful in predicting which species are likely to thrive in human degraded landscapes. We also emphasize the need to consider both positive and negative species responses when assessing consequences of habitat change in communities.},

  abstract = {A fitness landscape relates the genotype of an organism to its reproductive capacity and therefore has a central role in evolutionary biology.Introduced in the 1930s, the fitness landscape concept has long been used primarily as a metaphor. This has recently changed, as new experimental tools allow the systematic construction and analysis of combinations of predefined sets of genetic mutations.The topography of the fitness landscape is determined by how different mutations interact in their effect on fitness. A particular type of epistasis known as sign epistasis causes the fitness landscape to be rugged, possibly with multiple peaks.A survey of experimental studies shows that most empirical fitness landscapes are rugged, but the amount of ruggedness varies systematically depending on the way the mutations that form the landscape have been chosen.On rugged fitness landscapes, the accessibility of mutational pathways towards higher fitness is reduced, which makes the evolutionary process more constrained and hence predictable. In addition, predictability depends on population size in ways that can be explored using mathematical modelling.A key challenge for the future is to extend current fitness landscape studies to genome-wide scales and to develop models that are informed by the interactions of biomolecules.},

  abstract = {According to theory, habitat selection by organisms should reflect underlying habitat-specific fitness consequences and, in birds, reproductive success has a strong impact on population growth in many species. Understanding processes affecting habitat selection also is critically important for guiding conservation initiatives. Northern pintails (Anas acuta) are migratory, temperate-nesting birds that breed in greatest concentrations in the prairies of North America and their population remains below conservation goals. Habitat loss and changing land use practices may have decoupled formerly reliable fitness cues with respect to nest habitat choices. We used data from 62 waterfowl nesting study sites across prairie Canada (1997\textendash 2009) to examine nest survival, a primary fitness metric, at multiple scales, in combination with estimates of habitat selection (i.e., nests versus random points), to test for evidence of adaptive habitat choices. We used the same habitat covariates in both analyses. Pintail nest survival varied with nest initiation date, nest habitat, pintail breeding pair density, landscape composition and annual moisture. Selection of nesting habitat reflected patterns in nest survival in some cases, indicating adaptive selection, but strength of habitat selection varied seasonally and depended on population density and landscape composition. Adaptive selection was most evident late in the breeding season, at low breeding densities and in cropland-dominated landscapes. Strikingly, at high breeding density, habitat choice appears to become maladaptive relative to nest predation. At larger spatial scales, the relative availability of habitats with low versus high nest survival, and changing land use practices, may limit the reproductive potential of pintails.},

  abstract = {We analysed whether patterns of microhabitat use by Blue Tits Parus caeruleus, Great Tits Parus major and Crested Tits Parus cristatus inhabiting a mixed forest consistently matched the patterns of food availability experienced by foraging birds during spring-summer. The use of five microhabitats by each bird species (the foliage of three tree species, shrubs and ground) and the availability of food in trees during the prebreeding, breeding and post-breeding periods of the birds' annual cycle were measured. All three tit species foraged mainly in the outer part of tree canopies (small branches and leaves or needles). Tit distributions between tree species matched food resource distributions irrespective of overall food resource levels, which varied four-fold between the study periods, and tit species. Tits also exploited secondary microhabitats (shrubs and ground) in periods of low food availability; Blue Tits tended to use shrubs, whereas Great and Crested Tits foraged on the ground. Between-trees distributions fitted that expected from an ideal free distribution, suggesting that food availability and intraspecific exploitative competition were the main factors governing tree use by tits. In contrast, patterns of use of secondary microhabitats (shrubs and ground) seemed to indicate a role for the species-specific morphological configurations of each tit species since Blue Tits are better adapted to hang and tended to forage in shubs, whereas Great and Crested Tits are better adapted to feed on horizontal surfaces and tended to forage on the ground. No evidence of interspecific interactions was observed. Overall, the results pointed to an independent exploitation of Mediterranean mixed forest by each bird species, food availability and food accessibility being the main factors affecting microhabitat use by foraging tits.},

As a result, sampling biases must be inferred from the data themselves.

We also characterize user behavior on the platform in terms of individual activity level and taxonomic specialization. We found that, at the level of taxonomic class, the users typically specialized on a particular group, especially plants or insects, and rarely made observations of the same species twice. Biodiversity scientists should consider whether user behavior results in systematic biases in their analyses before using iNaturalist data.},

We examined habitat selection by juvenile black-capped vireos (Vireo atricapilla) following their independence from parental care, in 2010\textendash 2013 on Fort Hood Military Reservation in central Texas, USA. The black-capped vireo is a federally endangered species that nests almost exclusively in shrub vegetation, but previous anecdotal observations indicate that juveniles may prefer riparian vegetation. We used mist-net capture rates and radio-telemetry to determine relative abundance of juvenile vireos across habitats, to quantify movement patterns and habitat selection, and to investigate how vegetation density and arthropod abundance influenced habitat selection. We captured juveniles at similar rates in shrub and riparian vegetation. Radio telemetry data indicated that juveniles selected riparian vegetation over most other available vegetation types, and tended to stay in riparian vegetation upon arrival. Juveniles selected areas characterized by more canopy cover, denser foliage, and more arthropods. Riparian vegetation provides this combination of features more than other vegetation types, indicating that cover and food are the basis for habitat selection by juveniles. Our results indicate that habitat conservation strategies for black-capped vireos should include protection of riparian vegetation near breeding areas, and more generally, that avian conservation strategies that focus only on breeding areas may potentially overlook other key habitats. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Wildlife Society.},

  abstract = {The possibility of complicated dynamic behavior driven by nonlinear feedbacks in dynamical systems has revolutionized science in the latter part of the last century. Yet despite examples of complicated frequency dynamics, the possibility of long-term evolutionary chaos is rarely considered. The concept of ``survival of the fittest'' is central to much evolutionary thinking and embodies a perspective of evolution as a directional optimization process exhibiting simple, predictable dynamics. This perspective is adequate for simple scenarios, when frequency-independent selection acts on scalar phenotypes. However, in most organisms many phenotypic properties combine in complicated ways to determine ecological interactions, and hence frequency-dependent selection. Therefore, it is natural to consider models for evolutionary dynamics generated by frequency-dependent selection acting simultaneously on many different phenotypes. Here we show that complicated, chaotic dynamics of long-term evolutionary trajectories in phenotype space is very common in a large class of such models when the dimension of phenotype space is large, and when there are selective interactions between the phenotypic components. Our results suggest that the perspective of evolution as a process with simple, predictable dynamics covers only a small fragment of long-term evolution.},

The procedure, known as the Mantel test in the biological and environmental sciences, includes any analysis relating two distance matrices or, more generally, two proximity matrices. In this paper, we discuss the extent to which a Mantel type of analysis between two proximity matrices agrees with Pearson's correlation analysis when both methods are applicable (i.e., the raw data used to calculate proximities are available). First, we demonstrate that the Mantel test and Pearson's correlation analysis should lead to a similar decision regarding their respective null hypothesis when squared Euclidean distances are used in the Mantel test and the raw bivariate data are normally distributed. Then we use fish and zooplankton biomass data from Lake Erie (North American Great Lakes) to show that Pearson's correlation statistic may be nonsignificant while the Mantel statistic calculated on nonsquared Euclidean distances is significant. After small-size artificial examples, seven bivariate distributional models are tried to simulate data reproducing the difference between analyses, among which three do reproduce it. These results and some extensions are discussed. In conclusion, particular attention must be paid whenever relations established between proximities are backtransposed to raw data, especially when these may display patterns described in the body of this paper.},

  abstract = {Natural selection should no longer be thought of simply as a primitive (magical) concept that can be used to support all kinds of evolutionary theorizing. We need to develop causal theories of natural selection; how it arises. Because the factors contributing to the creation of natural selection are expected to be complex and intertwined, theories explaining the causes of natural selection can only be developed through the experimental method. Microbial experimental evolution provides many benefits that using other organisms does not. Microorganisms are small, so millions can be housed in a test tube; they have short generation times, so evolution over hundreds of generations can be easily studied; they can grow in chemically defined media, so the environment can be precisely defined; and they can be frozen, so the fitness of strains or populations can be directly compared across time. Microbial evolution experiments can be divided into two types. The first is to measure the selection coefficient of two known strains over the first 50 or so generations, before advantageous mutations rise to high frequency. This type of experiment can be used to directly test hypotheses. The second is to allow microbial cultures to evolve over many hundreds or thousands of generations and follow the genetic changes, to infer what phenotypes are selected. In the last section of this article, I propose that selection coefficients are not constant, but change as the population becomes fitter, introducing the idea of the selection space.},

Comparing female condition between incubation and nestling periods, we aimed at testing whether biometric differences in F. hypoleuca females were caused by assortative settlement (i.e. intraspecific competition) or as a consequence of breeding in environments exposed to different levels of pollution stress. Body mass, wing length, fat reserves, age distribution, timing of breeding and breeding density of females were measured along an air pollution gradient from a copper smelter in SW Finland in 1991\textemdash 1994. We found few differences in female quality which could be explained by assortative settling. Females were of the same size in all areas. At nestling time P. major females were heaviest in a moderately polluted area. However, females in the most polluted area were not lighter than those in background areas. Female fat reserves in both species were smaller in the polluted area in one cold breeding season. This suggests that natural (weather) and human induced (pollution) stress factors affected female condition additively. The proportion of young F. hypoleuca females was slightly higher in the polluted area than elsewhere. P. major females started laying earlier near the factory complex than farther away. F. hypoleuca females laid later in the polluted area in early breeding seasons but in late seasons laying started simultaneously everywhere. Especially F. hypoleuca bred more sparsely in the polluted area. Observed differences in the condition of F. hypoleuca females along the pollution gradient emerged mainly in the course of breeding.}

The tannin content of oak leaves increases from a low level in April to at least 2{$\cdot$}4 per cent (fresh weight) in September. Condensed tannin first appears in the leaves in late May. Winter moth larvae, Operophtera brumata (L.), were reared in the laboratory on an artificial diet containing casein. It was found that the presence in the diet of as little as 1 per cent tannin, extracted from September oak leaves, caused a significant reduction in larval growth rate and pupal weight. The effect is thought to be due to reduction of protein available to the larvae. The presence of increasing amounts of tannin in oak leaves as the season progresses may be one factor influencing selection for early larval feeding periods on oak leaves.},

Increasing leaf toughness is a proximate, though probably not ultimate, factor preventing late larval feeding by the winter moth, the commonest spring species on oak. Early feeding coincides with maximum leaf protein content and mimum leaf sugar content, with suggests that availability of nitrogen, rather than of carbohydrate, may be a limiting factor for spring\textemdash feeding larvae. The content of oak leaf tannins, which inhibit the growth of winter moth larvae, increases during the summer and may render leaves less suitable for insect growth by further reducing the availability of nitrogen and perhaps also by influencing leaf palatability. Oak trees are extensively damaged by insect attack, and it is likely that leaf tannins have a defensive function against insects as well as against other herbivores and against pathogens.},

  abstract = {Conifer dominated plantations in central and northern Europe are associated with relatively low ecological values, and in some cases, may be vulnerable to disturbances caused by anthropogenic climate change. This has prompted the consideration of alternative tree species compositions for use in production forestry in this region. Here we evaluate the likely biodiversity costs and benefits of supplanting Norway spruce (Picea abies) monocultures with polycultures of spruce and birch (Betula spp.) in southern Sweden. This polyculture alternative has previously been evaluated in terms of economic, recreational, and silvicultural benefits. By also assessing the ecological implications we fill a gap in our understanding of the range of socio-ecological benefits that can be achieved from a single polyculture alternative. We project likely broad scale changes to species richness and abundance within production stands for five taxonomic groups including ground vegetation, tree-living bryophytes, lichens, saproxylic beetles, and birds. Our research leads us to three key findings. First, the replacement of spruce monocultures with spruce\textendash birch polycultures in the managed forest landscapes of southern Sweden can be expected to result in an increase in biological diversity for most but not all taxa assessed, but it is unlikely to improve conditions for many red-listed forest species. Second, modification of other aspects of forest management (i.e. rotation length, dead wood and green tree retention, thinning regimes) is likely to contribute to further biodiversity gains using spruce\textendash birch polycultures than spruce monocultures. Third, the paucity of empirical research which directly compares the biodiversity of different types of managed production stands, limits the extent to which policy relevant conclusions can be extracted from the scientific literature. We discuss the wider implications of our findings, which indicate that some climate change adaptation strategies, such as risk-spreading, can be readily integrated with the economic, environmental and social goals of multi-use forestry.},

  abstract = {1. Citizen and community-science (CS) datasets have great potential for estimating interannual patterns of population change given the large volumes of data collected globally every year. Yet, the flexible protocols that enable many CS projects to collect large volumes of data typically lack the structure necessary to keep consistent sampling across years. This leads to interannual confounding, as changes to the observation process over time are confounded with changes in species population sizes. 2. Here we describe a novel modeling approach designed to estimate species population trends while controlling for the interannual confounding common in citizen science data. The approach is based on Double Machine Learning, a statistical framework that uses machine learning methods to estimate population change and the propensity scores used to adjust for confounding discovered in the data. Additionally, we develop a simulation method to identify and adjust for residual confounding missed by the propensity scores. Using this new method, we can produce spatially detailed trend estimates from citizen science data. 3. To illustrate the approach, we estimated species trends using data from the CS project eBird. We used a simulation study to assess the ability of the method to estimate spatially varying trends in the face of real-world confounding. Results showed that the trend estimates distinguished between spatially constant and spatially varying trends at a 27km resolution. There were low error rates on the estimated direction of population change (increasing/decreasing) and high correlations on the estimated magnitude. 4. The ability to estimate spatially explicit trends while accounting for confounding in citizen science data has the potential to fill important information gaps, helping to estimate population trends for species, regions, or seasons without rigorous monitoring data.},

However, the factors that influence the evolution of elevational distributions remain uncertain. I used a database of sister species of tropical montane birds from 41 families and three regions\textemdash the Neotropics, the Himalayas, and New Guinea\textemdash to test whether patterns of elevational divergence were consistent with (1) a stochastic process, (2) ecological sorting of elevational divergence that occurred in allopatry, or (3) elevational divergence driven by competitive interactions upon secondary contact. The stochastic and ecological sorting hypotheses predict that increased elevational divergence in sympatric sister species is explained by their greater evolutionary age, whereas the competitive interactions hypothesis predicts that elevational divergence is explained by geographical overlap. I found that genetic distances were unrelated to elevational divergence and that allopatric sister species occupied similar elevational distributions regardless of genetic distance in each region. Instead, sympatry was the only significant predictor of elevational divergence; regardless of evolutionary age, sympatric sister species had greater elevational divergence than allopatric sister species in each region, as predicted by the competitive interactions hypothesis. Importantly, this pattern occurred in all three geographic regions, which suggests that competition-driven elevational divergence upon secondary contact is a general process of community assembly in tropical montane avifaunas.},

  abstract = {Geographically isolated populations of birds often differ in song. Because birds often choose mates on the basis of their song, song differentiation between isolated populations constitutes a behavioral barrier to reproduction. If this barrier is judged to be sufficiently strong, then isolated populations with divergent songs may merit classification as distinct species under the biological species concept. We used a dataset of 72 pairs of related but allopatric Neotropical passerines (``taxon pairs'') to compare 2 methods for measuring song divergence between isolated populations: statistical analysis of 7 acoustic traits measured from spectrograms, and field playback experiments that ``ask the birds themselves'' if they perceive foreign song as conspecific or not. We report 4 main findings: (1) Behavioral discrimination (defined as failure to approach the speaker in response to allopatric song) is nonlinearly related to divergence in acoustic traits; discrimination is variable at low to moderate levels of acoustic divergence, but nearly uniformly high at high levels. (2) The same nonlinear relationship held for both song learners (oscines) and nonlearners (suboscines). (3) Song discrimination is not greater in taxon pairs ranked as species compared to taxon pairs ranked as subspecies. (4) Behavioral responses to allopatric song are symmetric within a taxon pair. We conclude (1) that playback experiments provide a stronger measure of species recognition relevant to premating reproductive isolation than do acoustic trait analyses, at least when divergence in acoustic traits is low to moderate; and (2) that playback experiments are useful for defining species limits and can help address the latitudinal gradient in taxonomy, which arises because species are defined more broadly in the tropics than in the temperate zone. To this end, we suggest that 21 Neotropical taxon pairs that are currently ranked as subspecies, but that show strong behavioral discrimination in response to allopatric song, merit classification as distinct biological species.},

Our findings support projections that warming will likely drive widespread extirpations and extinctions of high-elevation taxa in the tropical Andes. Such climate change-driven mountaintop extirpations may be more likely in the tropics, where temperature seems to exert a stronger control on species' range limits than in the temperate zone. In contrast, we show that lowland bird species at our study site are expanding in range size as they shift their upper limits upslope and may thus benefit from climate change.},

We test contrasting predictions of these hypotheses by conducting a global comparative test of birds' elevational range sizes within 31 montane regions, using more than 4.4 million citizen science records from eBird to define species' elevational ranges in each region. We find strong support that competition, not climate, is the leading driver of narrow elevational ranges. These results highlight the importance of species interactions in shaping species' ranges in tropical mountains, Earth's hottest biodiversity hotspots.           ,              Tropical mountain biodiversity                            Mountains in the tropics are highly biodiverse, often with entirely different sets of species occurring at high and low elevations. This high turnover occurs because species occupy narrower elevational ranges in the tropics than on temperate mountains. Freeman               et al               . used citizen science data from eBird, a global citizen science project, to test two hypotheses for narrower ranges in the tropics. The prevailing hypothesis is that tropical species experience less seasonal variation in temperature and thus have narrower climatic niches, but an alternative view is that ranges may be limited by competition with other species. Freeman               et al               . found that species richness is a better predictor of smaller elevational ranges than climate seasonality, suggesting a larger role of competition in shaping tropical mountain biodiversity than has previously been recognized. \textemdash BEL                        ,              Competition with other species, not climate, explains the narrower elevational ranges of bird species on tropical versus temperate mountains.},

  abstract = {Relationships among area, habitat heterogeneity and bird assemblages were examined for 21 forest fragments (3 to 7620 ha) in an agricultural landscape near Ottawa, Canada. Habitat heterogeneity within forests was measured by an index of spatial variability (HH) in plant species and forest structure. HH based on tree species or shrub species increased with forest size. Larger and more heterogeneous forests had more species and pairs of birds, according to multiple regressions for two summers combined. Number of species and pairs of birds at individual points within forests increased with greater HH but not with larger size. Birds also were more patchily distributed in more heterogeneous, but not necessarily large, forests, because of relatively uncommon species. Larger forest size was more important for increasing species number in forest-interior and resident-related classes of birds. Some classes, e.g. forest interior species, were infrequent in smaller forests. Habitat heterogeneity was more important to edge-related classes. To maintain a diverse forest avifauna, regional conservation strategies should maximise both size and habitat heterogeneity of forests.},

  abstract = {The relative roles of natural and sexual selection in promoting evolutionary lineage divergence remains controversial and difficult to assess in natural systems. Local adaptation through natural selection is known to play a central role in promoting evolutionary divergence, yet secondary sexual traits can vary widely among species in recent radiations, suggesting that sexual selection may also be important in the early stages of speciation. Here, we compare rates of divergence in ecologically relevant traits (morphology) and sexually selected signalling traits (coloration) relative to neutral structure in genome-wide molecular markers and examine patterns of variation in sexual dichromatism to explore the roles of natural and sexual selection in the diversification of the songbird genus Junco (Aves: Passerellidae). Juncos include divergent lineages in Central America and several dark-eyed junco (J. hyemalis) lineages that diversified recently as the group recolonized North America following the last glacial maximum (ca. 18,000 years ago). We found an accelerated rate of divergence in sexually selected characters relative to ecologically relevant traits. Moreover, sexual dichromatism measurements suggested a positive relationship between the degree of colour divergence and the strength of sexual selection when controlling for neutral genetic distance. We also found a positive correlation between dichromatism and latitude, which coincides with the geographic axis of decreasing lineage age in juncos but also with a steep ecological gradient. Finally, we found significant associations between genome-wide variants linked to functional genes and proxies of both sexual and natural selection. These results suggest that the joint effects of sexual and ecological selection have played a prominent role in the junco radiation.},

In this research we conducted a scoping review to systematically search peer-reviewed journal databases for research that has employed spatial cluster analysis methods on individual-level, address location, or x and y coordinate derived data. To illustrate the thematic issues raised by our results, methods were tested using a dataset where known clusters existed. Point pattern methods, spatial clustering and cluster detection tests, and a locally weighted spatial regression model were most commonly used for individual-level, address location data (n = 29). The spatial scan statistic was the most popular method for address location data (n = 19). Six themes were identified relating to the application of spatial cluster analysis methods and subsequent analyses, which we recommend researchers to consider; exploratory analysis, visualization, spatial resolution, aetiology, scale and spatial weights. It is our intention that researchers seeking direction for using spatial cluster analysis methods, consider the caveats and strengths of each approach, but also explore the numerous other methods available for this type of analysis. Applied spatial epidemiology researchers and practitioners should give special consideration to applying multiple tests to a dataset. Future research should focus on developing frameworks for selecting appropriate methods and the corresponding spatial weighting schemes.},

By emphasizing the ecological and evolutionary basis of resistance, the book makes an important contribution to the study of how phytophages and plants coevolve.  Plant Resistance to Herbivores and Pathogens not only reviews the literature pertaining to plant resistance from a number of traditionally separate fields but also examines significant questions that will drive future research. Among the topics explored are selection for resistance in plants and for virulence in phytophages; methods for studying natural variation in plant resistance; the factors that maintain intraspecific variation in resistance; and the ecological consequences of within-population genetic variation for herbivorous insects and fungal pathogens.

  abstract = {Behavioural plasticity during habitat selection plays a key role in determining whether organisms may thrive under human-induced rapid environmental changes. As organisms rely on environmental cues to make decisions, these behavioural responses may be maladaptive. We studied the European stonechat Saxicola torquatus as a model open-habitat bird species breeding in three structurally different land-use types generated by agriculture and forestry activities. In this mosaic landscape, we compared the relative attractiveness and the breeding habitat quality of intensive grassland, Christmas tree plantations and clear-cut patches in plantation forests to test whether habitat selection was adaptive. We examined the settlement pattern of territorial males to evaluate habitat preference. We recorded key parameters reflecting reproductive performances, adult and first-year survival to estimate the individual fitness of the birds and assess the quality of the different land-use types for breeding. Stonechats preferentially settled in clear-cut patches, but their fitness was not found to be markedly different in comparison with the other occupied habitats. Although they produced slightly lower-quality offspring in clear-cut patches, we did not find a negative consequence on first-year survival probabilities or any among-habitat differences in adult survival. With our analysis integrating multiple components of individual fitness, we show that all occupied land-use types are similarly rewarding for the breeding stonechats. Our study shows that some species can benefit from novel land-use types emerging in the landscape as a result of human activities. Flexible habitat selection in the stonechat has most probably contributed to its recent population increase in Western Europe.},

Gyps vultures have been killed by the widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac, ingested when they feed on carcasses of domesticated ungulates treated with the drug shortly before death. However, it is not known whether Egyptian Vulture and Red-headed Vulture are also sensitive to diclofenac. Veterinary use of diclofenac was banned in India in 2006. Since then, the prevalence and concentration of diclofenac in domesticated ungulates carcasses has decreased and population declines of Gyps vultures have slowed or reversed. Here, we examine counts of Egyptian and Red-headed Vultures obtained on road transects in and near protected areas between 1992 and 2011. We found indications that the declines in both species appear to have slowed and possibly increased after the ban was introduced, though the small numbers of birds counted make this conclusion less robust than that for the Gyps species. These results suggest that both species may have been adversely impacted by diclofenac and that government bans on this drug, which are beginning to take effect, may benefit a wider range of vulture species in the Indian subcontinent than was previously thought.},

Despite the importance of these autumn interactions, their potential to shift with climate change and species invasions remains poorly understood. As invasive fleshy-fruited shrubs spread across the Northeast USA and many landbird species pass through stopover sites later with warming temperatures, the potential for changes in bird-fruit interactions depends on the phenology and availability of native and invasive wild fruits, and bird preferences across the autumn season. We observed the fruiting phenology of 25 native and invasive fleshy-fruited wild plant species at Manomet, a migratory stopover site on the coast of Massachusetts, USA, during the autumn migration season (August to November) in 2014 and 2015. We also monitored fruit availability across Manomet in 2015. To determine whether fruit consumption reflected phenology and availability, we identified seeds from 469 fecal samples collected from songbirds captured during the 2014 and 2015 autumn banding seasons. We found that while invasive shrubs fruited later, on average, than native plants, and comprised a large proportion of the total available fruits in late-autumn, birds primarily consumed the fruits of native species throughout the autumn season. Our results demonstrate that native fruits are an important food resource for birds during the autumn migration season and are unlikely to be replaced by abundant fruits of late-season invasive species under climate change.},

Satellite remote sensing data sets can be useful for quantifying habitat heterogeneity across a range of spatial scales. Past remote sensing analyses of species diversity have largely been limited to correlative studies based on the use of vegetation indices or derived land cover maps. A relatively new form of laser remote sensing (lidar) provides another means to acquire information on habitat heterogeneity. Here we examine the efficacy of lidar metrics of canopy structural diversity as predictors of bird species richness in the temperate forests of Maryland, USA. Canopy height, topography and the vertical distribution of canopy elements were derived from lidar imagery of the Patuxent National Wildlife Refuge and compared to bird survey data collected at referenced grid locations. The canopy vertical distribution information was consistently found to be the strongest predictor of species richness, and this was predicted best when stratified into guilds dominated by forest, scrub, suburban and wetland species. Similar lidar variables were selected as primary predictors across guilds. Generalized linear and additive models, as well as binary hierarchical regression trees produced similar results. The lidar metrics were also consistently better predictors than traditional remotely sensed variables such as canopy cover, indicating that lidar provides a valuable resource for biodiversity research applications.},

In the coastal Maulino forest, central Chile, both species richness and abundance of insectivorous birds increases in forest fragments compared to continuous forest. Through a field experiment, we examined larvae predation in fragmented forests. Higher richness and abundance of birds foraging at forest fragments translated into more insect larvae preyed upon in forest fragments than in continuous forest. The assessed level of insectivory in forest fragments agrees with lower herbivory levels in forest fragments. This pattern strongly suggests the strengthening of food interactions web in forest fragments of coastal Maulino forest.},

  abstract = {This new version of the bibliography, first compiled in 2010 only for terrestrial birds, has been expanded to include most vertebrate taxa in which mixed-species groups (MSGs) are found. There are now separate pages for terrestrial birds, waterbirds, mammals and fish, mixed-taxa groups, and theoretical papers that apply to more than one taxa.  We define MSGs as moving groups of more than one species, in which the species are not simply inside or on each other, and which persist due to interspecific attraction. In contrast, mixed-species aggregations or colonies are stationary associations that, in addition to interspecific attraction, are also influenced by resources or predator-free space, respectively. As invertebrate mixed groups rarely move together, but rather include various kinds aggregations and colonies, they rarely make our definition of MSG (those behaviours described as mixed `swarms' may closest to vertebrate MSGs). Nevertheless, this year we start a separate page for invertebrates, which we hope can be expanded in the future. As ornithologists, and ones who concentrate on terrestrial species, we are not so knowledgeable about many of the taxa here. We hope that if you know of other articles that are relevant that you will please write us. Further, if you are willing to improve the database (e.g. add information about specific habitats or systematics of species), we would be glad to work with you. Finally, we have many of the electronic copies of the articles, so write us if you are looking for an article in particular.}

  abstract = {The life cycles of plants and animals are changing around the world in line with the predictions originated from hypotheses concerning the impact of global warming and climate change on biological systems. Commonly, the search for ecological mechanisms behind the observed changes in bird phenology has focused on the analysis of climatic patterns from the species breeding grounds. However, the ecology of bird migration suggests that the spring arrival of long-distance migrants (such as trans-Saharan birds) is more likely to be influenced by climate conditions in wintering areas given their direct impact on the onset of migration and its progression. We tested this hypothesis by analysing the first arrival dates (FADs) of six trans-Saharan migrants (cuckoo Cuculus canorus, swift Apus apus, hoopoe Upupa epops, swallow Hirundo rustica, house martin Delichon urbica and nightingale Luscinia megarhynchos), in a western Mediterranean area since from 1952 to 2003. By means of multiple regression analyses, FADs were analysed in relation to the monthly temperature and precipitation patterns of five African climatic regions south of the Sahara where species are thought to overwinter and from the European site from where FADs were collected. We obtained significant models for five species explaining 9\textendash 41\% of the variation in FADs. The interpretation of the models suggests that: (1) The climate in wintering quarters, especially the precipitation, has a stronger influence on FADs than that in the species' potential European breeding grounds. (2) The accumulative effects of climate patterns prior to migration onset may be of considerable importance since those climate variables that served to summarize climate patterns 12 months prior to the onset of migration were selected by final models. (3) Temperature and precipitation in African regions are likely to affect departure decision in the species studied through their indirect effects on food availability and the build-up of reserves for migration. Our results concerning the factors that affect the arrival times of trans-Saharan migrants indicate that the effects of climate change are more complex than previously suggested, and that these effects might have an interacting impact on species ecology, for example by reversing ecological pressures during species' life cycles.},

However, it is still poorly understood how animals can cope with and adapt to these rapid and dramatic transformations of natural environments. The COVID-19 pandemic provides us with a unique opportunity to unveil the mechanisms involved in this process. Lockdown measures imposed in most countries are causing an unprecedented reduction of human activities, giving us an experimental setting to assess the effects of our lifestyle on biodiversity. We studied the birds' response to the population lockdown by using more than 126 000 bird records collected by a citizen science project in northeastern Spain. We compared the occurrence and detectability of birds during the spring 2020 lockdown with baseline data from previous years in the same urban areas and dates. We found that birds did not increase their probability of occurrence in urban areas during the lockdown, refuting the hypothesis that nature has recovered its space in human-emptied urban areas. However, we found an increase in bird detectability, especially during early morning, suggesting a rapid change in the birds' daily routines in response to quieter and less crowded cities. Therefore, urban birds show high behavioural plasticity to rapidly adjust to novel environmental conditions, such as those imposed by the COVID-19.},

  abstract = {Citizen science data are increasingly used for biodiversity monitoring. However, concerns are often raised over the accuracy of species identifications in citizen science databases, as data are collected mostly by non-professionals. Misidentifications can simultaneously generate two error types: false positives (erroneous reports of a species) and false negatives (lack of reports of the misidentified species). Large-scale assessments of identification errors should bring insights into the strengths and weaknesses of citizen-science data. Here we show that citizen science photographic data for birds are trustworthy overall, although problems arise in hard-to-identify bird groups. We reviewed over 104 000 images of 377 passerine species from the southern Neotropics (Argentina) stored in eBird \textendash a large citizen science platform\textendash{} and quantified erroneous reports to calculate precision and recall metrics as measures for data accuracy. Precision increases with fewer false positives and recall increases with fewer false negatives, thus high values of precision and recall will mirror a higher data accuracy. We found that 97\% of the photos of all species were correctly identified. Most species (77\%; n = 291) showed high accuracy in their identifications (precision and recall {$>$} 95\%), with 122 species showing no errors. A few hard-to-identify species (10\%; n = 40) showed low levels of data quality (63-90\% precision or recall). Similarly, few species (12\%; n = 46) exhibited intermediate precision or recall scores (90-95\%]. Further, we uncovered the existence of a complex network of cross-identifications composed of 272 species, with a predominance of tyrant-flycatchers and ovenbirds, reflecting the strong traffic of errors that occurs within these families. To our knowledge, our study provides the first large-scale quantification of identification errors in photos submitted by citizen-science contributors. We underscore the relevance of performing such assessments to understand how identification errors are distributed across a database before analyzing data and provide tools for citizen science stakeholders to direct more specific efforts toward species that need an improvement in data quality.},

  abstract = {The world's most revered and eloquent interpreter of evolutionary ideas offers here a work of explanatory force unprecedented in our time\textemdash a landmark publication, both for its historical sweep and for its scientific vision. With characteristic attention to detail, Stephen Jay Gould first describes the content and discusses the history and origins of the three core commitments of classical Darwinism: that natural selection works on organisms, not genes or species; that it is almost exclusively the mechanism of adaptive evolutionary change; and that these changes are incremental, not drastic. Next, he examines the three critiques that currently challenge this classic Darwinian edifice: that selection operates on multiple levels, from the gene to the group; that evolution proceeds by a variety of mechanisms, not just natural selection; and that causes operating at broader scales, including catastrophes, have figured prominently in the course of evolution. Then, in a stunning tour de force that will likely stimulate discussion and debate for decades, Gould proposes his own system for integrating these classical commitments and contemporary critiques into a new structure of evolutionary thought. In 2001 the Library of Congress named Stephen Jay Gould one of America's eighty-three Living Legends\textemdash people who embody the ``quintessentially American ideal of individual creativity, conviction, dedication, and exuberance.''

  abstract = {Invasive, non-native plants threaten forest ecosystems by reducing native plant species richness and potentially altering ecosystem processes. Seed dispersal is critical for successful invasion and range expansion by non-native plants; dispersal is likely to be enhanced if they can successfully compete with native plants for disperser services. Fruit production by non-native plants during winter (or dormant season), when native fruits and arthropods are scarce, might enhance chances of fruit consumption and seed dispersal by vertebrates. We compared the proportion and rate of fruit removal among five invasive, non-native and two native plant species that retain fruit during winter to test whether non-native fruits are readily removed and their seeds dispersed by vertebrates-even where native fruit is available. We also assessed whether the nutritional content of fruit pulp affects fruit removal rates, and collected bird droppings from fecal traps to examine species and rates of seed dispersal. Most (83\% to 93\%) fruit was removed from all species except native Smilax rotundifolia L. (55\%). Most (92\%) seeds collected from bird droppings were from non-native plants (six species); only 8\% were from native plants (four species). Mean fruit survival time (across species) was positively correlated with total sugar and negatively correlated with lipid. Total fruit consumed was not correlated with nutrient content. Our results indicate most fruits of tested winter-fruiting, non-native invasive plants are removed, and their seeds are dispersed. In the southern Appalachian Mountains, only a few native plant species, notably greenbriar (Smilax spp.), American holly (Ilex opaca Alton), and sumac (Rhus spp.) retain abundant, ripe fruit during winter months, and these species tend to be patchy in their distribution. Therefore, winter fruit availability by non-native invasive plants offers an important opportunity for dispersal and range expansion, and is likely key in their successful invasion of ecosystems.},

  abstract = {It is important to monitor bird populations both in their own right and as indicators of the general health of wildlife habitats. The objectives of the British Trust for Ornithology's Integrated Population Monitoring programme relate to breeding bird populations in Britain and Ireland and involve the estimation of demographic parameters as well as assessment of numbers. Current programmes for monitoring bird numbers cover the majority of British species; it would be feasible to monitor most of the rest. A new Breeding Bird Survey has been developed to provide effective coverage of all regions and all major habitats in Britain through random sampling, allowing for the marked geographical variation in volunteer observer density. The final choice of a random sample stratified by observer density (with some professional support in regions with few volunteer observers) was based on comparison with alternative stratifications, using data from a 2-year pilot study to assess the number of species adequately covered under various alternatives. A method of assessing whether or not targets are being achieved at any time has been developed: it involves looking back through the data at intervals of 1-year, 4-year, 16-year and longer spans. It will be possible to refine this by incorporating environmental and density-dependent effects into predictive models. The method is illustrated here using Common Birds Census data. We discuss associated problems of statistical inference and of taking decisions under uncertainty. The data provide evidence for large declines in some species, particularly in farmland; the value of birds as general indicators of habitat health is clear. The results of monitoring can be used to illuminate possible causes of problems and to guide both practical steps to ameliorate the problems and research aimed at better understanding the causes. Examples of such research are discussed.},

Therefore, finding opportunities to conserve biodiversity within the human-modified landscape is crucial. Ecologists have begun paying attention to fragments of biodiversity habitats in the urban landscapes in the past few decades. Of these, academic campuses offer a unique opportunity to evaluate such fragments due to well-preserved green spaces within the campuses and maintenance of biodiversity data. We studied the scope of academic campuses in India for their biodiversity potential vis-\`a-vis their ability to retain the habitat for native biodiversity. We used bird richness as a surrogate to biodiversity as they are the most widely monitored species group. Academic campuses (n~=~335) in India reported 779 bird species, with an average of 88 species per campus. The species included five critically endangered, seven endangered, 17 vulnerable, and 33 near-threatened species. Several campuses worldwide have held intact natural habitats for centuries. The campuses in India underwent human-induced habitat modification significantly less than their surrounding landscape in last one decade. The academic campuses globally could prove hugely beneficial in securing a wide variety of species in relatively small land areas. While our study was restricted to academic campuses, non-academic campuses such as the army, industrial and private establishments could further add to such spaces. The campuses could also serve as living repositories and evolutionary labs for plant and small animal species that remain isolated due to fragmentation.},

  abstract = {Tree diversity is an important driver of forest ecosystem functioning, hypothesised to enhance tree growth and resistance to herbivores. To test this, we assessed the relative importance of tree species richness and functional diversity on tree height growth and insect herbivore damage across three tree diversity experiments in Finland, France and Germany, established within the last fifteen years. These experiments encompass species richness gradients from monocultures up to five species mixtures, with compositions drawn from a pool of eleven tree species. Tree height growth and total insect herbivory were evaluated at both the tree species and forest plot scales. Trees in mixtures tended to grow taller, but on average received more insect herbivory relative to monocultures. Gradients of tree species richness or functional diversity had only weak impact on the magnitude of these effects. Community weighted means of specific leaf area alone captured diversity effects on tree height growth, with stronger positive effects of diversity in mixtures with high community SLA. Tree species-specific responses were highly variable. No species significantly benefited both in terms of increased growth and reduced herbivory when grown in mixtures. More species showed positive height growth responses in mixed assemblages, but only the two exotic conifers experienced associational resistance to herbivores. This large-scale study shows that tree height growth in young forest plantations tends to be higher in species mixtures than in monocultures, but incremental increases in functional diversity have, at best, weak marginal growth benefits. Moreover, there appear to be contrasting effects at forest plot versus individual species scales. Thus, while some species show lower herbivore damage in mixtures, this is not a consistent trend and contrasts the higher overall damage in mixtures observed at the forest plot scale. To improve both tree growth and resistance to herbivores in tree species mixtures seems therefore challenging.},

  abstract = {Under laboratory conditions, two mechanisms have been identified that control the onset of migration. One mechanism inflexibly controls the initiation of migration, while the other requires external input from a changing environment. It has been suggested that the evolution of these mechanisms has an ecological basis related to the wintering latitude of the species. To establish whether the timing of migration was consistent with this ecological explanation, we studied the long-term mean timing of spring migration, and within-year and among-year variance in timing, in 27 free-living Nearctic migrant species. Species that wintered in higher, temperate latitudes migrated significantly earlier than tropical-wintering species. Tropical-wintering species showed significantly less within-year and among-year variation in the timing of migration, suggesting that the mechanism regulating their migration is primarily endogenous, with little influence of external stimuli. In contrast, breeding latitude showed no relationship to the mean date of migration, or the within-year or among-year variation in timing. These results are consistent with the notion that conditions that indicate time-of-year are unreliable or change imperceptibly (photoperiod) in the tropics, making an endogenous circannual clock valuable for controlling the onset and progression of migration. Temperate-wintering species were more likely to show interspecific correlations in timing than tropical species, further suggesting that external cues modulate spring migration in temperate-wintering species. Our results indicate that the migration regulation system employed might be ultimately determined by wintering latitude and associated environmental cues.},

  abstract = {Non-coniferous vegetation, including herbs, shrubs, and broad-leaved trees, makes a vital contribution to ecosystem function and diversity in Pacific Northwest conifer forests. However, forest management has largely been indifferent or detrimental to shrubs and trees that have low commercial value, in spite of a paradigm shift towards more holistic management in recent decades. Forest management practices that are detrimental to broad-leaved trees and shrubs are likely to decrease habitat diversity for wildlife, but the number of species that may be affected has not previously been enumerated. I reviewed life history accounts for forest-dwelling vertebrate wildlife species and derived a list of 78 species in Oregon and Washington that are associated with non-coniferous vegetation. The diversity of direct and indirect food resources provided was the primary functional basis for associations of most species with non-coniferous vegetation. Thus, a diversity of herbs and broad-leaved trees and shrubs provides the foundation for food webs that contribute to diversity at multiple trophic levels in Pacific Northwest conifer forests. Given the number of species associated with non-coniferous vegetation in conifer-dominated forests, maintaining habitats that support diverse plant communities, particularly broad-leaved trees and shrubs, will be an important component of management strategies intended to foster biodiversity. Silvicultural practices such as modified planting densities, and pre-commercial and commercial thinning, can be used to control stand density in order to favor the development of understory herbs, shrubs, and a diversity of tree species within managed stands. Allowing shrubs and hardwood trees to develop and persist in early seral stands by curtailing vegetation control also would benefit many species associated with non-coniferous vegetation.},

To obtain insights into the history of this relict biota, we modelled the spatial distribution of habitats during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in the Russian Altai. We prepared a map of the current vegetation of this area based on the ground-truthed remote sensing data, and modelled the distribution of the current vegetation types using the Random Forest technique with climatic predictors. The models were projected onto the CCSM3 model of the LGM climate for the Russian Altai and interpreted for 72\% of its area because the remaining part is supposed to have been glaciated during the LGM. The models projected LGM predominance of desertsteppe across most of the non-glaciated area of the Russian Altai, probably associated with areas of typical steppe, tundra grasslands and some other habitat types, including forest patches in stream valleys. It is likely that during the LGM, these habitats supported the cold-adapted open-landscape biota. In the Holocene, most of the previous grassland area changed into forest or forest-steppe and the Pleistocene biota retreated, with the exception of the Chuya Basin and the Ukok Plateau in the southeast, where the habitat change was very small and desert-steppe and associated vegetation types remained preserved. This refugial area is currently rich in the relict Pleistocene species. A different history was suggested for the precipitation-rich area in the northernmost Altai (north of Lake Teletskoye), where the LGM models suggested occurrence of patches of open forest of Larix sibirica and Pinus sibirica in forest-tundra and forest-steppe landscapes. These forests may have provided the LGM refugium for the temperate forest species that currently occur in this precipitation-rich area.},

Forty-seven articles used the term "habitat;" however, it was only defined and used consistent with our definition in 5 articles (11\%) and was confused with vegetation association or defined incompletely in 42 papers (89\%). "Habitat type" was the term most commonly used incorrectly; 16 of 17 times (94\%) it was used to indicate vegetation association, but habitat and vegetation association are not synonymous. Authors did not provide definitions for habitat use, selection, preference, or availability 23 of 28 times (82\%). We concluded that habitat terminology was used vaguely in 82\% of the articles we reviewed. This distorts our communication with scientists in other disciplines and alienates the public because we give ambiguous, indefinite, and unstandardized answers to ecological questions in public and legal situations. Scientists should define and use habitat terminology operationally, so that the concepts are measurable and accurate. We must take the challenge to standardize terminology seriously, so that we can make meaningful statements to advance science.}

  abstract = {For several decades, economists have been warning the academic community that graduate training has been too tightly focused on careers in higher education, using the apprenticeship model in which students are trained to become tenure-track faculty at research-focused institutions. These jobs are simply not growing at the same rate as graduate admissions. In biomedical research, the mismatch in supply and demand has now been widely recognized. Other disciplines have begun these discussions, but for smaller fields, employment trends are more difficult to identify because they are subsumed in aggregated national statistics. For non-biomedical biological fields in particular, such as ecology, using biology statistics may be inappropriate since trends within the field may be obscured by the strong signal from biomedical disciplines. Here, we use the 2013 Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) to investigate career paths for ecology Ph.D. recipients in the United States, and present the first fine-scale national profile of careers in ecology. Our results demonstrate that while involuntary unemployment is low for ecology Ph.D. recipients (3.3\%) and job satisfaction is high, the assumptions of the prevailing apprenticeship model are inappropriate: Less than 20\% of employed recent ecology Ph.D. graduates are in tenure-track positions at a Ph.D.-granting university. Accordingly, proactive steps could be taken to create more realistic expectations about graduate training and preparation for diverse careers. Further, the SDR data provide demographic profiles for ecology. Ethnic diversity has remained low in ecology (7.5\% non-Caucasian for Ph.D. recipients since 2000). Gender balance in career-track positions appears to have improved by multiple metrics. However, women are overrepresented in non-tenure-track academic positions, where access to resources that support professional advancement may be limited relative to tenure-track jobs, and salary disparities appear for women in private academic institutions. Thus, while there is much good news in these data, we suggest that ecology as a field would benefit from (1) a broad analysis of the training required to make Ph.D.s best prepared for jobs outside of the research-oriented tenure track and (2) continued attention to increasing diversity and equity.},

The main drivers of occupancy were found to be the extent of broadleaf woodland cover and the degree of urbanization. Detection probability was influenced by date, time, weather, and moon phase. Using the current method, a minimum of five to six survey visits per site would be required to have 95\% confidence over the presence or absence of Tawny Owls at a given site, but it may be possible to optimize the survey method further to increase efficiency by surveying in the autumn or early spring, early after dusk, and on cloudless dry evenings close to the full moon.Conclusion The findings indicate that survey methodologies for surveying Tawny Owls can be optimized to increase the efficiency of detection, if present at a site. We highlight the need for further research on the effects of urbanization on Tawny Owls, particularly with regards to artificial light pollution and its effects on behaviour and settlement, along with the need for greater understanding of Tawny Owl activity budgets, which would aid the interpretation of survey results.}

  abstract = {Although deforestation and forest degradation have long been considered the most significant threats to tropical biodiversity, across Southeast Asia (Northeast India, Indochina, Sundaland, Philippines) substantial areas of natural habitat have few wild animals ({$>$}1 kg), bar a few hunting-tolerant species. To document hunting impacts on vertebrate populations regionally, we conducted an extensive literature review, including papers in local journals and reports of governmental and nongovernmental agencies. Evidence from multiple sites indicated animal populations declined precipitously across the region since approximately 1980, and many species are now extirpated from substantial portions of their former ranges. Hunting is by far the greatest immediate threat to the survival of most of the region's endangered vertebrates. Causes of recent overhunting include improved access to forests and markets, improved hunting technology, and escalating demand for wild meat, wildlife-derived medicinal products, and wild animals as pets. Although hunters often take common species, such as pigs or rats, for their own consumption, they take rarer species opportunistically and sell surplus meat and commercially valuable products. There is also widespread targeted hunting of high-value species. Consequently, as currently practiced, hunting cannot be considered sustainable anywhere in the region, and in most places enforcement of protected-area and protected-species legislation is weak. The international community's focus on cross-border trade fails to address overexploitation of wildlife because hunting and the sale of wild meat is largely a local issue and most of the harvest is consumed in villages, rural towns, and nearby cities. In addition to improved enforcement, efforts to engage hunters and manage wildlife populations through sustainable hunting practices are urgently needed. Unless there is a step change in efforts to reduce wildlife exploitation to sustainable levels, the region will likely lose most of its iconic species, and many others besides, within the next few years.},

Using data from long-term seabird monitoring, we reveal a previously concealed guarding effect by tourist groups on an iconic seabird colony in the Baltic Sea. The absence of tourists in 2020 lead to a sevenfold increase in presence of white-tailed eagles Haliaeetus albicilla, a sevenfold increase in their disturbance of breeding common murres Uria aalge and causing 26\% lower murre productivity than the long-term average. Eagles did not prey on murres, but their frequent disturbances delayed egg laying and facilitated egg predation from herring gulls Larus argentatus and hooded crows Corvus cornix. Based on our findings, we suggest that human presence could be used as a strategic measure in guarding seabird colonies, and that a social-ecological systems perspective is vital for long-term success in protected area management.},

Both species are almost completely insectivorous during breeding in Europe and wintering in sub-Saharan Africa, but are known to consume fleshy fruits during summer-autumn migration, though no detailed investigations have been carried out over long periods of time. In this study, the summer-autumn feeding ecology of Pied and Spotted Flycatchers in a stopover area in north-west Spain, with a landscape of hedgerows and irrigated meadows, was studied for five consecutive years (2002\textendash 2006). In general, the passage of both flycatcher species was noticeable from mid-August to the end of September, with a peak in the first ten days of September. The two flycatcher species consumed fruits throughout the stopover period in all years, with constant intensity of frugivory in time, though the importance of fruits was almost three times greater in the diet of Pied Flycatchers (c. 30\% of feeding acts) than in that of Spotted Flycatchers (c. 10\% of feeding acts). Both species preferred Dogwood Cornus sanguinea fruits, but also ate Elder Sambucus nigra berries and Bramble Rubus spp. drupelets. The high level of selection of Dogwood fruits was probably linked to their high lipid content, an essential nutrient for fattening in long-distance migrant passerines. Hedgerows and wood edges in north-west Iberia are rich in fleshy fruits but threatened by intensive farming. Their conservation and restoration are proposed because they seem to be high-quality stopover habitats for partially frugivorous passerines during summer-autumn migration.},

  abstract = {There is a conspicuous gradient in the proportion of passerine breeding communities contributed by tropical migrants (PPM) in Europe, with communities located in the northernmost areas showing the greatest percentages and those located to the south the smallest. I used multiple stepwise regression and regression on principal components to investigate the effects of a set of ecological, climatic, and geographical variables on migrant percentages in a sample of 55 European censuses distributed from northern Fennoscandia through southern Spain. When the main habitat types are considered individually, this geographic pattern is still significant. The best single predictor of PPM as revealed by multiple regression analyses is latitude, but when this variable is removed, the temperature of the coldest month provides almost equivalent predictions of PPM. Habitat type per se apparently does not influence substantially the percent of migrants in European breeding passerine communities. These results contrast with those reported by MacArthur (1959) for North America, although they are consistent with some suggestions derived from the recent reanalysis of North American data carried out by Willson (1976). Intercontinental differences are perhaps due to sampling deficiencies in the North American areas studied, mainly derived from the restricted latitudinal range. To explain the European pattern of PPM, I suggest that the percentage of migrants in a community during the breeding season depends on both the harshness of adverse winter conditions faced by the resident populations and on the total resource availability during the breeding period. Carrying capacity of the habitat during the severe season will to some extent regulate the size of resident populations in the following breeding period, which in turn must affect the abundance of migrants that may successfully colonize the habitat. Very harsh winters coupled to very productive breeding seasons favor the largest percentage of migrants.},

  abstract = {(1) A southern Spanish passerine bird community was studied throughout a year, collecting information on species composition and abundance, as well as foraging behaviour and feeding site utilization of component species. In this paper, comparisons of behavioural, morphological and feeding site niche characteristics between resident and non-resident species are made. (2) For all species, within-species foraging diversity is significantly greater for non-resident than for resident species, indicating that individual resident species have a narrower repertoire of foraging tactics than non-resident ones. On a seasonal basis, between-species foraging diversity for non-residents is higher than that for residents during spring and early summer, but it falls well below the figures for resident species in winter. (3) Resident species are morphologically more diversified and less densely packed in the morphological space than non-resident ones. Resident species tend to show a wider range of bill length, and to be long-billed, with respect to non-residents. (4) Resident species exhibited feeding site niche shifts in response to its own population density, higher densities promoting wider niches as theoretically expected. Non-residents did not show comparable shifts, although some degree of response to density was noted. (5) A canonical correlation analysis was able to show that resident and non-resident species adjust themselves to the changing environment in different ways. Whereas residents do it by means of changes in density, niche breadth and between-species foraging diversity, non-residents species achieve the same end by means of changes in morphological specialization, behavioural specialization and diversity of foraging tactics, all of which take place through seasonal replacements of species. (6) The seasonal organization of the study community is discussed in relation to other temperate and non-temperate communities. It is proposed that the observed great dominance of residents with respect to number of individuals may be associated with a relatively low degree of seasonality in food supply to birds. The reliability and predominating abundance throughout the annual cycle of the food types exploited by residents, are likely to explain the maintenance of the high behavioural and morphological specialization by individual resident species. The wide spacing on the morphological space among these species may be related to the regular occurrence of periodic phases of food shortage during which this spacing might be vital to survival.},

Despite the foliage structure being simpler, neither species richness nor density was less than those in mature temperate forests. Species diversity was higher in the western Madagascan forest owing to the higher species evenness. Tree-cavity nesters and bark foragers were few because woodpeckers, nuthatches, and tits have not colonized Madagascar. The scarcity of birds nesting on or near the forest floor may be attributable to abundance of nest-predators such as large lizards and snakes in these areas. The bird community was dominated in abundance by the members of mixed-species flocks, almost all of which forage in the canopy. Mixed-flocking can be beneficial for these birds to avoid predation by raptors, which were frequently observed in the canopy. Since most of the flock members had relatively similar territory sizes resulting in similar densities, the high species evenness in this community may have resulted from mixed-flocking by canopy-foraging species.},

The woods differed strikingly in structure due to their management systems; one was predominantly mature oak and the other coppice, comprising a patchwork of growth stages. Fine-scale relationships between breeding bird species distributions, determined by mapping censuses, and canopy height and canopy cover were assessed. Despite the differences in structure, species showed great consistency between the woods in their rank positions across gradients of canopy height (rank correlation between woods, r = 0.77, p {$<$} 0.001) and canopy cover (r = 0.61, p = 0.003). In both woods, and especially the mature oak (R2{$>$} 0.90, p {$<$} 0.001), there was a positive correlation across bird species between the mean values of canopy height and canopy cover associated with the mapped locations of each species. We suggest that canopy height acts as an effective surrogate of woodland structure and can be applied as a predictor of woodland bird composition and distribution, at least in lowland British conditions. Species associated with young growth were more restricted by habitat structure, as measured by differences in canopy height and canopy cover between the two woods, than were species associated with taller canopies. Remote sensing of canopy height potentially offers a simple, effective way of assessing habitat availability for many species, at both woodland and landscape scales. This may be especially relevant for species dependent on highly transient vegetation structures associated with the early pre-canopy closure stages of forest growth.},

The four regions were selected both for their early and prolonged periods of mandated changes to human activity, and because of the high densities of observations collected. We compared the months of April 2020 with April in previous years. The most notable change was in the landscapes in which observations were made: in all but one region human-dominated landscapes were proportionally more common in the data in April 2020, and observations made near the rarer wetland habitat were less prevalent. We also found subtler changes in quantity of data collected, as well as in observer effort within observation periods. Finally, we found that these effects of COVID-19 disease varied across the political units, and thus we conclude that any analyses of eBird data will require region-specific examination of whether there have been any changes to the data collection process during the COVID-19 pandemic that would need to be taken into account.},

Adult populations responded directly to shade, reed cover, amenity-managed land use and bank height, and indirectly to BOD and ammonia concentrations. Distribution patterns were strongly associated with both natural changes along the river system and management impacts. River management practices locally disrupted the natural displacement of species along the river, but whilst some forms of human interference on river systems were beneficial to species richness, the effects on stenotopic species were disadvantageous. To conserve Odonata management emphasis should be on the maintenance of suitable conditions for river specialists.},

However, we find that the degree of co-occurrence does vary among studies that use different methods to survey microbial communities. Finally, we discuss the potential effects of the undersampling of microbial communities on our results, as well as processes that may contribute to nonrandom patterns of co-occurrence in both macrobial and microbial communities such as competition, habitat filtering, historical effects, and neutral processes.},

The correction is of particular use when the sample size is small, or when the number of fitted parameters is a moderate to large fraction of the sample size. The corrected method, called AICC, is asymptotically efficient if the true model is infinite dimensional. Furthermore, when the true model is of finite dimension, AICC is found to provide better model order choices than any other asymptotically efficient method. Applications to nonstationary autoregressive and mixed autoregressive moving average time series models are also discussed.},

  abstract = {This paper aimed to fulfil the knowledge gap on the status of vagrants and rare birds of Nepal. Records of all Nepal's bird species that were previously considered vagrants by the National Red List of Nepal's Birds (2016) were collated and detailed with localities, dates and observers. Species recorded since 2016, including vagrant species, were also covered. A total of 92 species was assessed to determine if they were vagrants, that is species that had a total of 10 or less records. It was concluded that six species are no longer vagrant and we recommend these for national red list assessment. Nepal currently has a total of 71 vagrant species. In addition, four vagrant species have still to be accepted by the Nepal Rare Birds Committee before they can be officially included on the Nepal bird list. Nine species have so far only been recorded in the 19th century. Red-faced liocichla Liocichla phoenicea, was previously one of these, but was re-found In Nepal after the National Red List was published in 2016; it is a very rare and very local resident. Himalayan grasshopper-warbler Locustella kashmirensis is a recent split and now considered a full species (instead of a subspecies); it is probably an altitudinal migrant in Nepal. Despite great advances in our ornithological knowledge of Nepal, there is still high potential to find new species, especially of passerine birds and in the less explored parts of the country.},

  abstract = {Citizen-science driven exercises (e.g. bird surveys) and online platforms (e.g. eBird) provide voluminous data on bird occurrence. However, the semi-structured nature of their data collection makes it difficult to compare bird distribution across space and time. Bird atlases are based on standardized surveys and describe the distribution of bird species over a predefined region and have fewer biases, and thus are better suited for use in research. The recently concluded Kerala Bird Atlas (henceforth KBA) is Asia's largest bird atlas in terms of geographical extent, sampling effort and species coverage. The entire state of Kerala was systematically surveyed twice a year during 2015\textendash 20 and over 0.3 million records of 380 species from 25,000 checklists were aggregated. The dataset was filtered and various metrics were estimated. A total of 915 cells were laid out for systematic surveys, of which 888 were surveyed in either or both the seasons \textendash{} dry season (January\textendash March) and wet season (July\textendash September); 27 cells could not be surveyed in either of the seasons due to logistical constraints. However, this variation in sampling effort had a minimal effect on survey completeness. The slope of the species accumulation curve suggested nearcomplete species sampling in over 70\% of the cells. After eliminating nocturnal and pelagic species, data from 361 species were analysed. Species count was higher in the dry season than in the wet season. Species richness (count) and evenness were higher in the northern and central districts than in the southern districts. High elevation regions of the southern Western Ghats were the largest contiguous areas lacking sufficient sampling. We found that most of the endemics were concentrated in the Western Ghats, but threatened species were as likely to occur along the coasts as in the Ghats. The KBA dataset is a valuable resource for testing various ecological hypotheses and suggesting science-backed conservation measures. KBA model could be replicated for similar atlases in other states or biogeographic regions of India.},

The number of species in 10 km transects was positively correlated to the proportions of forest {$>$} 40 yrs and Mixed forest {$>$}40 yrs, as well as the number of fragments of the latter, while negatively correlated to the proportions of clear-cuts and young forest. Transects with {$>$}60\% older forest including {$>$} 6\% mixed habitats showed the highest number of bird species and individuals. The positive effect on species numbers of mixed forest was stronger in the study area where deciduous rich habitats were generally less abundant. Bird species richness in points of similar habitat was negatively correlated to the degree of fragmentation of the surrounding older forest. However, in a species-by-species analysis at the transect level no effects of fragmentation were found. The number of bird species at points was positively influenced by the increase from 0 to 5\% deciduous trees, while no effect of higher deciduous site proportions showed. The hazel grouse (Bonasa bonasia) appeared as a significant indicator of high bird diversity at the transect (landscape) level, by all methods used. However, the conclusion was reached that forests where the hazel grouse, blue tit (Parus caeruleus), treecreeper (Certia familiaris), jay (Garrulus glandarius) and capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus) are present are most likely to hold the potential for high bird species richness.},

Psocoptera, Aphidoidea and Lepidoptera larvae were the most common insects in autumn. In Feb\textendash Mar only 1\% remained, most of the decline occurring already early in the winter. Spiders were almost as common as Psocoptera in autumn but survived winter to 28\textendash 45\%. Spiders therefore are potentially more important food for wintering birds than are insects. Through the first five winters there was a steady increase in density of small (but not large) spiders both in autumn (290\%) and spring (390\%). Spring densities of small but not large spiders were significantly correlated to autumn densities. Usually there was no added variability of spider abundance between trees and most of the variability was found within trees. In autumn spiders occurred at significantly higher densities in the lower half of the spruce trees than in the upper half. Much of the reduction of large spiders over winter is known to be caused by predation by birds. Over winter, this predation probably makes the distribution of spiders within trees more uniform. The autumn density of three tit species, the goldcrest and the treecreeper was significantly correlated with the density of large spiders at the same time, but not with small spiders (which they presumably do not eat). This might be caused by territorial behaviour being related to food density in autumn.},

  abstract = {Habitat selection is a fundamental component of community ecology, population ecology, and evolutionary biology and can be especially important to species with complex annual habitat requirements, such as migratory birds. Resource preferences on the breeding grounds may change during the postfledging period for migrant songbirds, however, the degree to which selection changes, timing of change, and whether all or only a few species alter their resource use is unclear. We compared resource selection for nest sites and resource selection by postfledging juvenile ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla) and Acadian flycatchers (Empidonax virescens) followed with radio telemetry in Missouri mature forest fragments from 2012-2015. We used Bayesian discrete choice modeling to evaluate support for local vegetation characteristics on the probability of selection for nest sites and locations utilized by different ages of postfledging juveniles. Patterns of resource selection variation were species-specific. Resource selection models indicated that Acadian flycatcher habitat selection criteria were similar for nesting and dependent postfledging juveniles and selection criteria diverged when juveniles became independent from adults. After independence, flycatcher resource selection was more associated with understory foliage density. Ovenbirds differed in selection criteria between the nesting and postfledging periods. Fledgling ovenbirds selected areas with higher densities of understory structure compared to nest sites, and the effect of foliage density on selection increased as juveniles aged and gained independence. The differences observed between two sympatric forest nesting species, in both the timing and degree of change in resource selection criteria over the course of the breeding season, illustrates the importance of considering species-specific traits and postfledging requirements when developing conservation efforts, especially when foraging guilds or prey bases differ. We recommend that postfledging habitat selection be considered in future conservation efforts dealing with Neotropical migrants and other forest breeding songbirds.},

  abstract = {Modern ecological research often involves the comparison of the usage of habitat types or food items to the availability of those resources to the animal. Widely used methods of determining preference from measurements of usage and availability depend critically on the array of components that the researcher, often with a degree of arbitrariness, deems available to the animal. This paper proposes a new method, based on ranks of components by usage and by availability. A virtue of the rank procedure is that it provides comparable results whether a questionable component is included or excluded from consideration. Statistical tests of significance are given for the method. The paper also offers a hierarchical ordering of selection processes. This hierarchy resolves certain inconsistencies among studies of selection and is compatible with the analytic technique offered in this paper.},

This synthesis incorporates research on the ecology and evolution within communities over short timescales (community genetics and diffuse coevolution), as well as macroevolutionary timescales (community phylogenetics and co-diversification of communities). As we discuss here, preliminary evidence supports the hypothesis that there is a dynamic interplay between ecology and evolution within communities, yet researchers have not yet demonstrated convincingly whether, and under what circumstances, it is important for biologists to bridge community ecology and evolutionary biology. Answering this question will have important implications for both basic and applied problems in biology.},

However, data from eBird or other large-scale projects with volunteer observers typically present several challenges that can impede robust ecological inferences. These challenges include spatial bias, variation in effort and species reporting bias. Innovation We use the example of estimating species distributions with data from eBird, a community science or citizen science (CS) project. We estimate two widely used metrics of species distributions: encounter rate and occupancy probability. For each metric, we critically assess the impact of data processing steps that either degrade or refine the data used in the analyses. CS data density varies widely across the globe, so we also test whether differences in model performance are robust to sample size. Main conclusions Model performance improved when data processing and analytical methods addressed the challenges arising from CS data; however, the degree of improvement varied with species and data density. The largest gains we observed in model performance were achieved with 1) the use of complete checklists (where observers report all the species they detect and identify, allowing non-detections to be inferred) and 2) the use of covariates describing variation in effort and detectability for each checklist. Occupancy models were more robust to a lack of complete checklists. Improvements in model performance with data refinement were more evident with larger sample sizes. In general, we found that the value of each refinement varied by situation and we encourage researchers to assess the benefits in other scenarios. These approaches will enable researchers to more effectively harness the vast ecological knowledge that exists within CS data for conservation and basic research.},

  abstract = {Habitat selection is an important process in birds that influences individual survival and fitness, and ultimately shapes population dynamics. As a consequence, strong selective pressures apply to favor strategies allowing individuals to choose high-quality habitat for foraging while reducing predation risk and competition. In long-distance migratory birds, such as shorebirds, the non-breeding period is considered as a key period of their annual cycle with reported effects on individual survival and subsequent reproduction. Site selection by non-breeding shorebirds should depend on habitat quality for them to ensure survival until the next breeding season. More specifically, birds should distribute in space and time according to their resource availability and specialize on feeding habitats or/and prey to reduce intraspecific competition. To test this hypothesis, we studied Bar-tailed Godwits (Limosa lapponica) at one of their main non-breeding sites along the French coast. We first used GPS tracking to investigate their foraging and roosting home ranges as well as core sampling to define the diversity of available habitats and their quality as feeding resources. We then compared individual habitat selection in relation to feeding home range sizes and benthic macrofauna abundances. Our results provide the first fine scale definition of shorebird movements and distribution along the non-breeding period. We found that godwits showed an extreme fidelity to restricted feeding areas (about 3.4~km2) during winter, with low overlap between individual feeding home ranges. Each bird appeared to mainly use 4\textendash 6 of the 11 available foraging habitats, with a specialization on 1 to 2 main habitats and their associated prey. However, our results did not emphasize a clear relationship between home range sizes and the quality of bird feeding sites. This study thus demonstrates the high specialization of individual non-breeding Bar-tailed godwits relying on specific foraging grounds and habitats, with important implications for the conservation of this species.},

Because the long-phase species spend a longer time in terrestrial habitats such as grasslands or woodlands during their pre-reproductive phase, we hypothesized that long-phase species would be more sensitive to landscape structure than short-phase species. To test this hypothesis, we conducted periodic censuses of adult dragonflies at small man-made ponds. We compared the two above functional groups in terms of the degree to which species occurrence depended on landscape structure. The difference among the two groups was not significant, but occurrence of longphase species tended to depend on landscape structure. Long-phase species responded to landscape structure at larger spatial scales and showed stronger spatial autocorrelation in their occurrence among sampling ponds than short-phase species.},

These variables accounted for 82\% of the variation in insect species richness between British trees. (5) When the regression analysis was repeated, but halted after the entry of the last significant F value, log abundance, time and evergreenness emerged as the best set of predictor variables for the numbers of insect species on British trees and accounted for 74\% of the variation.}

  abstract = {Patterns of habitat use by some passerines change after the young leave the nest, and thus our understanding of habitat selection derived from counts of singing males earlier in the nesting cycle may not adequately represent the breeding habitat requirements of these species. Post-fledging changes in habitat use may have important conservation implications if the survival of fledglings is affected by characteristics of the habitat; however, there have been relatively few systematic studies of the post-fledging ecology of forest passerines and, of these, even fewer have incorporated analyses of the relationship between habitat characteristics and fledgling survival. We studied the post-fledging habitat selection and survival of ovenbirds Seiurus aurocapilla in northern New Hampshire, USA during two breeding seasons using radio telemetry. Habitat at sites used by radio-marked fledgling ovenbirds was characterized by fewer large trees and greater vertical structure 0\textendash 3 m above ground than ovenbird nest sites. Similarly, habitat at sites used by fledgling ovenbirds was characterized by fewer large trees and greater vertical structure than unused sites. Most (80\%) of the 15 mortalities that we observed were due to predation. Nine (70\%) of these occurred within the first 3 days of fledging, resulting in a significant drop in survival during this period. Fledgling survival increased significantly with increased vegetation structure. Our observations that fledgling ovenbirds are selective in their habitat use, that they select different habitat features than adult ovenbirds select for nesting and that fledgling survival is positively associated with these habitat features suggest that the use of habitat models based on counts of singing males before fledging does not adequately represent the habitat needs of this species. Conceivably, mortality during the post-fledging period could limit recruitment to levels insufficient to maintain the viability of ovenbird population even if adequate nesting habitat were available.},

We also used cluster analysis to elucidate participation patterns, and we assessed changes in the geographical distribution of observation sites. The results showed: (1) the number of participants and observations decreased by 63\% and 68\%, respectively; however, the number of species was almost the same in the two years, and the identification rate increased 154\% in 2020 relative to 2019. (2) The most enthusiastic participants contributed in similar amounts in 2019 and 2020, but participation by less enthusiastic volunteers drastically declined. (3) The spatial distribution of observation sites changed from cluster-like to scattered. Understanding participant engagement during the pandemic could help to improve data quality, reduce geographical bias in observations, maintain records, and recruit more users in future years. Online citizen science could provide opportunities for many citizens to get outside and participate in conservation science during and after the pandemic.},

We focus on determining the relative impact of anthropogenic noise on nest site occupancy, compared to amount of forest cover, which is known to strongly influence the selection process. We examine chronic, industrial noise from natural gas wells directly measured at the nest box as well as site-averaged noise, using a well-established field experimental system in northwestern New Mexico. We hypothesized that high levels of noise, both at the nest site and in the environment, would decrease nest box occupancy. We set up nest boxes using a geospatially paired control and experimental site design and analyzed four years of occupancy data from four secondary cavity-nesting birds common to the Colorado Plateau. We found different effects of noise and landscape features depending on species, with strong effects of noise observed in breeding habitat selection of Myiarchus cinerascens, the Ash-throated Flycatcher, and Sialia currucoides, the Mountain Bluebird. In contrast, the amount of forest cover less frequently explained habitat selection for those species or had a smaller standardized effect than the acoustic environment. Although forest cover characterization and management is commonly employed by natural resource managers, our results show that characterizing and managing the acoustic environment should be an important tool in protected area management.},

  abstract = {Foraging behaviour of a guild of insectivorous gleaning birds was studied during three winters in relation to food availability in a larch forest. Important changes in microhabitat use and in searching technique occurred both during and between each winter. Among larch twig gleaners average microhabitat niche overlap increased with food availability. As bird predation had a significant impact on the food supply on larch twigs, this suggests the occurrence of competitive interactions. Utilization of larch twigs by each species was also correlated with its foraging behaviour: larch twig use decreased with decreasing use of hanging posture. In my study, "hanging" is assumed to be the most efficient posture for exploiting an abundant resource on larch twigs which are free of needles in winter. According to Norberg (1977), changes in resource availability involved changes in searching technique. "Hanging" ability on larch twigs was linked with morphological adaptations. The Goldcrest which had the weakest ability to hang, decreased its use of larch twigs probably because of exploitation competition. Interference competition was suggested by the complementarity between microhabitat use and foraging height observed among the larch twig gleaners. The important exploitation of larch seeds by the Willow Tit may be explained by the bill shape of this alpine subspecies without any competitive interaction.}

  abstract = {The dictionary definition of a law is: "Generalized formulation based on a series of events or processes observed to recur regularly under certain conditions; a widely observable tendency". I argue that ecology has numerous laws in this sense of the word, in the form of widespread, repeatable patterns in nature, but hardly any laws that are universally true. Typically, in other words, ecological patterns and the laws, rules and mechanisms that underpin them are contingent on the organisms involved, and their environment. This contingency is manageable at a relatively simple level of ecological organisation (for example the population dynamics of single and small numbers of species), and re-emerges also in a manageable form in large sets of species, over large spatial scales, or over long time periods, in the form of detail-free statistical patterns - recently called 'macroecology'. The contingency becomes overwhelmingly complicated at intermediate scales, characteristic of community ecology, where there are a large number of case histories, and very little other than weak, fuzzy generalisations. These arguments are illustrated by focusing on examples of typical studies in community ecology, and by way of contrast, on the macroecological relationship that emerges between local species richness and the size of the regional pool of species. The emergent pattern illustrated by local vs regional richness plots is extremely simple, despite the vast number of contingent processes and interactions involved in its generation. To discover general patterns, laws and rules in nature, ecology may need to pay less attention to the 'middle ground' of community ecology, relying less on reductionism and experimental manipulation, but increasing research efforts into macroecology.},

There is no evidence of interspecific territoriality or dominance by one species over the other. A close investigation of foraging behaviour, including choice of habitat, foraging postures and feeding curves, and of morphology (58 external and skeletal features measured) showed that their co-existence is facilitated by differences in feeding ecology. In a large outdoor aviary, newly caught birds were confronted with experimental trees denuded of natural food and their movements and postures were recorded. Independent of kind and occurence of prey, there are specific differences in preference for deciduous and coniferous trees and in the mode and speed of foraging. Firecrests show no particular preference between spruce and beech, whereas goldcrests clearly prefer spruce. Firecrests move more rapidly. Firecrests forage more often standing, whereas goldcrests more often cling vertically and hang. Differences in behaviour are more pronounced than differences in morphology investigated by multiple discriminant function analysis, but there are some morphological correlates: length of rictal bristles, width of gape and length of hind claw. External morphological characters discriminated best, then skeletal features and finally features of the flight apparatus. Furthermore, there are differences in the structures of the soles of the feet. Goldcrest soles are provided with deep furrows capable of gripping individual needles; firecrests have a smoother surface.}

A rich body of theory has been developed to predict the effects of plant diversity on communities at higher trophic levels and the mechanisms underlying such effects. The 'enemies hypothesis' states that predators exert more effective top\textendash down control of herbivorous insects with increasing plant diversity. Support for this hypothesis has been found in temperate forests and agroecosystems, but remains understudied in tropical forests. We compared incidence of attacks of different natural enemies using artificial caterpillars in a tropical forest landscape and investigated the role of plant community structure (i.e. species richness, composition and density), and the role of forest fragmentation (i.e. patch size, edge distance and canopy openness) on predation intensity. Plant community effects were tested with respect to three vegetation strata: trees, saplings and herbs. Observed predation was substantially due to ants. Predation rates increased with plant species richness for trees and herbs. Density of saplings, herb cover and herb species composition were important factors for predation. No significant patterns were found for fragmentation parameters, suggesting that forest fragmentation has not altered predation intensity. We conclude that in tropical forests, top\textendash down control of herbivorous insects in the understory vegetation is affected by a combination of plant diversity, plant species composition and structural features of the plant community.},

  abstract = {Background: Most cases of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) start with a bite from one of the subspecies of Glossina fuscipes. Tsetse use a range of olfactory and visual stimuli to locate their hosts and this response can be exploited to lure tsetse to insecticide-treated targets thereby reducing transmission. To provide a rational basis for cost-effective designs of target, we undertook studies to identify the optimal target colour. Methodology/Principal Findings: On the Chamaunga islands of Lake Victoria , Kenya, studies were made of the numbers of G. fuscipes fuscipes attracted to targets consisting of a panel (25 cm square) of various coloured fabrics flanked by a panel (also 25 cm square) of fine black netting. Both panels were covered with an electrocuting grid to catch tsetse as they contacted the target. The reflectances of the 37 different-coloured cloth panels utilised in the study were measured spectrophotometrically. Catch was positively correlated with percentage reflectance at the blue (460 nm) wavelength and negatively correlated with reflectance at UV (360 nm) and green (520 nm) wavelengths. The best target was subjectively blue, with percentage reflectances of 3\%, 29\%, and 20\% at 360 nm, 460 nm and 520 nm respectively. The worst target was also, subjectively, blue, but with high reflectances at UV (35\% reflectance at 360 nm) wavelengths as well as blue (36\% reflectance at 460 nm); the best low UV-reflecting blue caught 36 more tsetse than the high UV-reflecting blue. Conclusions/Significance: Insecticide-treated targets to control G. f. fuscipes should be blue with low reflectance in both the UV and green bands of the spectrum. Targets that are subjectively blue will perform poorly if they also reflect UV strongly. The selection of fabrics for targets should be guided by spectral analysis of the cloth across both the spectrum visible to humans and the UV region.},

We identify their three main limitations for characterizing the geographic distributions of species: unknown levels of survey effort, unknown absences of a species from a region, and unknown level of repeated occurrence of a species in different samples collected at the same location. These limitations hinder our ability to distinguish between the actual absence of a species at a given location and its (erroneous) apparent absence as consequence of inadequate surveys. Good practice in biodiversity research requires knowledge of the number, location and degree of completeness of relatively well-surveyed inventories within territorial units. We herein present KnowBR, an application designed to simultaneously estimate the completeness of species inventories across an unlimited number of spatial units and different geographical extents, resolutions and unit expanses from any biodiversity database. We use the number of database records gathered in a territorial unit as a surrogate of survey effort, assuming that such number correlates positively with the probability of recording a species within such area. Consequently, KnowBR uses a ``record-by-species'' matrix to estimate the relationship between the accumulated number of species and the number of database records to characterize the degree of completeness of the surveys. The final slope of the species accumulation curves and completeness percentages are used to discriminate and map well-surveyed territorial units according to user criteria. The capacity and possibilities of KnowBR are demonstrated through two examples derived from data of varying geographic extent and numbers of records. Further, we identify the main advances that would improve the current functionality of KnowBR.},

What is critically needed today is an integrated, real-world approach to ecology that reflects the interdependency of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. From Populations to Ecosystems proposes an innovative theoretical synthesis that will enable us to advance our fundamental understanding of ecological systems and help us to respond to today's emerging global ecological crisis. Michel Loreau begins by explaining how the principles of population dynamics and ecosystem functioning can be merged. He then addresses key issues in the study of biodiversity and ecosystems, such as functional complementarity, food webs, stability and complexity, material cycling, and metacommunities. Loreau describes the most recent theoretical advances that link the properties of individual populations to the aggregate properties of communities, and the properties of functional groups or trophic levels to the functioning of whole ecosystems, placing special emphasis on the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Finally, he turns his attention to the controversial issue of the evolution of entire ecosystems and their properties, laying the theoretical foundations for a genuine evolutionary ecosystem ecology. From Populations to Ecosystems points the way to a much-needed synthesis in ecology, one that offers a fuller understanding of ecosystem processes in the natural world.},

  abstract = {The use of model caterpillars to assess relative rates of predation has risen in popularity in recent years. Among the various benefits of the technique is its capacity to provide information on the identity of attackers through the impressions left in the modelling clay from which the model prey is constructed. However, there currently exists no detailed information on how to assign attack marks to particular predators. We aimed to address this gap by collating a comprehensive reference collection of the types of marks made by different predators to serve as a guide for researchers wanting to identify the predators responsible for attacks. To determine what level of resolution in identification may be considered reliable, we also tested the consistency of predator assignments made by different individuals. We found that predator identification at a coarse taxonomic level (i.e., bird, mammal, arthropod) was reasonably consistent. In contrast, when more fine-scale identification was attempted, the level of consistency and therefore also confidence in the accuracy of an identification was dramatically reduced, reflecting the difficulty of distinguishing between attacks made not only by different arthropod groups but also by differently sized birds and mammals. We recommend that identifications be made at a coarse taxonomic level and, where possible, by multiple individuals. We also suggest that our collection of images of representative attack marks from each of the coarse predator categories, and descriptions of their defining characteristics, can serve as a guide to assist with identifications and this will be complemented by a good knowledge of the locally occurring and abundant predators.},

For example, a more productive environment should lead to more restricted diet in numbers of different species eaten.

However, the anthropause resulting from COVID\textendash 19 lockdowns provided an unprecedented scenario to study the relative role of human activity on avian communities. Here we provide evidence of the relationships between human activity and bird species richness in urban areas of Colombia during its strict and subsequent relaxed lockdowns. Once the strict lockdown was lifted and human activity increased, avian species richness decreased by 32 \% in 46 \% of our sampling sites. Although the strict lockdown lasted only six weeks, local assemblages (mainly from low\textendash intensity urbanization peri\textendash urban sites) swiftly became more diverse. Our findings highlight the importance of taking human activity into account when planning cities, with important focus on greenspaces, if our aim is to conserve and enhance urban biodiversity. Such plans will require not only the cooperation of local governments but also greater awareness among the local population regarding the importance of creating livable, healthy, biodiverse, and resilient cities.},

  abstract = {Great White Pelicans Pelecanus onocrotalus feed mainly on fish and other aquatic organisms. In the Western Cape they display an unusual foraging behaviour: feeding on seabird chicks, with increasing extent and frequency since the mid 1990s. Seabird species targeted by pelicans include Cape Gannets Morus capensis, Cape Phalacrocorax capensis and Crowned P. coronatus Cormorants, Kelp Gulls Larus dominicanus and Swift Terns Sterna bergii. Bank Cormorants P. neglectus are occasionally disturbed by the activities of the pelicans. Pelicans use different hunting strategies for the diverse prey species, depending on their nesting characteristics and defensive behaviour of adults and chicks. The impact of predation on the breeding success of target species was assessed at four islands off the Western Cape in the summers of 2005/06 and 2006/07. A maximum of 200 pelicans was involved in predation events at the Saldanha Bay islands during peak predation by pelicans at the end of November. Pelican behaviour, time-budgets and all observed incidents of predation were recorded. The intensification of predatory interactions between pelicans and seabirds is linked to an increased population of pelicans and a diminished supply of artificial food sources for them. Pelican predation could have detrimental mid-term effects for local seabird populations. Proposed management actions are listed, providing a preliminary platform to discuss their effectiveness, pros and cons and other ethical considerations.},

Some nongovernmental organizations are working with ranchers to keep their lands out of development and in ranching, ostensibly because they believe biodiversity is better protected on ranches than on exurban developments. However, there are several assumptions underlying this approach that have not been tested. To better inform conservation efforts, we compared avian, mesopredator, and plant communities across the gradient of intensifying human uses from nature reserves to cattle ranches to exurban developments. We conducted surveys at randomly selected points on each type of land use in one Colorado watershed between May and August of 2000 and 2001. Seven bird species, characterized as human commensals or tree nesters, reached higher densities (all p Ͻ 0.02) on exurban developments than on either ranches or reserves. Six bird species, characterized as ground and shrub nesters, reached greater densities (all p Ͻ 0.015) on ranches, reserves, or both of these types of land use than on exurban developments. Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) and house cats ( Felis catus) were encountered almost exclusively on exurban developments, whereas coyotes (Canis latrans) were detected more frequently (p ϭ 0.047) on ranchlands than exurban developments. Ranches had plant communities with higher native species richness and lower non-native species richness and cover than did the other types of land use (all p Ͻ 0.10). Our results support the notion that ranches are important for protecting biodiversity and suggest that future conservation efforts may require less reliance on reserves and a greater focus on private lands.},

  abstract = {Background An understanding of the evolution of potential signals from plants to the predators of their herbivores may provide exciting examples of co-evolution among multiple trophic levels. Understanding the mechanism behind the attraction of predators to plants is crucial to conclusions about co-evolution. For example, insectivorous birds are attracted to herbivore-damaged trees without seeing the herbivores or the defoliated parts, but it is not known whether birds use cues from herbivore-damaged plants with a specific adaptation of plants for this purpose. Methodology We examined whether signals from damaged trees attract avian predators in the wild and whether birds could use volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions or net photosynthesis of leaves as cues to detect herbivore-rich trees. We conducted a field experiment with mountain birches (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii), their main herbivore (Epirrita autumnata) and insectivorous birds. Half of the trees had herbivore larvae defoliating trees hidden inside branch bags and half had empty bags as controls. We measured predation rate of birds towards artificial larvae on tree branches, and VOC emissions and net photosynthesis of leaves. Principal Findings and Significance The predation rate was higher in the herbivore trees than in the control trees. This confirms that birds use cues from trees to locate insect-rich trees in the wild. The herbivore trees had decreased photosynthesis and elevated emissions of many VOCs, which suggests that birds could use either one, or both, as cues. There was, however, large variation in how the VOC emission correlated with predation rate. Emissions of (E)-DMNT [(E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene], {$\beta$}-ocimene and linalool were positively correlated with predation rate, while those of highly inducible green leaf volatiles were not. These three VOCs are also involved in the attraction of insect parasitoids and predatory mites to herbivore-damaged plants, which suggests that plants may not have specific adaptations to signal only to birds.},

In this study we examine the characteristics and functions of the garden as a refuge during the period of increased garden interest associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysis of qualitative results about garden experiences from 3,743 survey respondents revealed intertwining garden and emotional geographies. Utilising non-representational and therapeutic landscape theories, we found multifarious and heightened experiences of non-material aspects of gardens; that is, the sensory and emotional aspects. People experienced, for example, a sense of joy, beauty, and reassurance, a greater attunement to the natural world and an increased sense of nature connection than they had at other times: birds felt louder. These heightened sensory and emotional experiences had therapeutic benefits, across age and geographical spectrums, during these difficult times. This research improves our understandings of the positive potential of non-material aspects of gardens in the creation of therapeutic landscapes in and beyond COVID-19.},

Within such landscapes, linear semi-natural habitats often define the edges of agricultural fields. This paper reviews the role and interactions within and between the flora of these elements. In temperate, intensive agriculture, such field margin habitats, which historically had true agricultural functions, now are important refugia for biodiversity. As manmade habitats, field margins may also have important cultural roles as part of our landscape heritage, e.g. hedges in Britain. Whilst field margins are not usually specific habitat types, they contain a variety of plant communities in a variety of structures. These may range from aquatic elements to ruderal and woodland communities. Studies demonstrate a variety of interactions between fields and their margins. Agricultural operations, such as fertiliser and pesticide application, have effects on the flora. Some margin flora may spread into crops, becoming field weeds. Margins also have a range of associated fauna, some of which may be pest species, while many are beneficial, either as crop pollinators or as pest predators. The biodiversity of the margin may be of particular importance for the maintenance of species at higher trophic levels, notably farmland birds, at the landscape scale. Margins contribute to the sustainability of production, by enhancing beneficial species within crops and reducing pesticide use. In northwestern Europe, a variety of methods to enhance diversity at field edges have been introduced, including sown grass and flower strips. The impact of these on weed flora and arthropods indicate mostly beneficial effects though conflicts exist, notably for the conservation of rare arable weed species.},

Our primary objective was to document whether or not birds typically considered mature or late-successional forest breeders were present in the clearcuts and if they were there with their young. Four mist-nets were located in each of six different forest clearcuts ranging in age from 1 to 7 years post-cut (at time of study initiation) and in size from 8.2 to 13.4ha. We caught 613 adult birds and 206 juvenile birds of 46 different species within these six different sites. Species typically associated with mature forest, such as the Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vermivorus), Red-eyed Vireo (Vireo olivaceus), Black-and-white Warbler (Mniotilta varia), Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), and Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus) were among the most commonly captured (adults, juveniles, and family groups). Seven Worm-eating Warblers originally color-banded on territories in adjacent mature forest were recaptured in clearcuts during the post-fledging period, four with dependent young. Although it was apparent that both the adults and young of species of forest-interior breeders were using regenerating clearcuts during the post-fledging period, we are unsure as to the exact reasons why, and, more importantly, whether these habitats enhance their survival.},

Fruit and understory foliage were concentrated in gaps. Birds that relied on these resources (foliage-gleaning insectivores, frugivores in autumn) used gaps more than non-gaps. Birds that fed on food other than fruit and foliage insects ("frugivores" in spring, other insectivores) did not use gaps more than non-gaps. Bird abundance varied markedly among gap and non-gap sites, potentially reflecting differences in site preferences. Site selection, as determined by bird abundances, was consistent (correlated) between years for birds that fed on items that were concentrated in gaps but not for birds that did not rely on these patchy resources. Foliage density is a measure of foraging substrates for foliage-gleaning birds to search. Abundance of foliage-gleaning insectivores was highly correlated with foliage density in both spring and autumn. Frugivore abundance was highly correlated with fruiting foliage density during autumn when they are frugivorous, but not during spring when they are insectivorous. Insectivores not relying on foliage insects or fruit were uncorrelated with either index of resource availability. These same relationships hold even when examining gap sites only. Thus, migrants can be consistent in their selection of foraging sites and this consistency appears to exist when resource densities are markedly different among sites (patchy) but not when resources are more dispersed.}

As a result, we have a poor understanding of how the ecological and evolutionary processes that create, maintain, and change biological diversity affect the flux of energy and materials in global biogeochemical cycles. The goal of this article was to review several research fields at the interfaces between ecosystem science, community ecology and evolutionary biology, and suggest new ways to integrate evolutionary biology and ecosystem science. In particular, we focus on how phenotypic evolution by natural selection can influence ecosystem functions by affecting processes at the environmental, population and community scale of ecosystem organization. We develop an eco-evolutionary model to illustrate linkages between evolutionary change (e.g. phenotypic evolution of producer), ecological interactions (e.g. consumer grazing) and ecosystem processes (e.g. nutrient cycling). We conclude by proposing experiments to test the ecosystem consequences of evolutionary changes.},

  abstract = {Birds during migration must satisfy the high energy and nutrient demands associated with repeated, intensive flight while often experiencing unpredictable variation in food supply and food quality. Solutions to such different challenges may often be physiologically incompatible. For example, increased food intake and gut size are primarily responsible for satisfying the high energy and nutrient demands associated with migration in birds. However, short-term fasting or food restriction during flight may cause partial atrophy of the gut that may limit utilization of ingested food energy and nutrients. We review the evidence available on the effects of long- and short-term changes in food quality and quantity on digestive performance in migratory birds, and the importance of digestive constraints in limiting the tempo of migration in birds. Another important physiological consequence of feeding in birds is the effect of diet on body composition dynamics during migration. Recent evidence suggests that birds utilize and replenish both protein and fat reserves during migration, and diet quality influences the rate of replenishment of both these reserves. We conclude that diet and phenotypic flexibility in both body composition and the digestive system of migratory birds are important in allowing birds to successfully overcome the often-conflicting physiological challenges of migration.},

We evaluated the woodpecker taxa as potential indicators of habitat quality and forest bird diversity in temperate moist hardwood forests (1500\textendash 2400~m asl), a threatened biome in the Western Himalaya. 74 forest sites, selected to represent a gradient of anthropogenic use, were surveyed for birds, vegetation structure and proportion of land under dense forest in the surrounding landscape. Individual woodpecker species were observed to quantify their foraging niche preferences. We found that forest sites with higher woodpecker richness were also rich in all other bird species. Further, the richness and abundance of woodpeckers and all other birds were affected by similar habitat variables. Four out of the eight woodpecker species occurring in the study area were found to fit our habitat models suitably, with canopy cover, tree density, and forest proportion proving to be important variables. Behavioural observations showed that the same four woodpecker species significantly preferred larger and taller trees for foraging. Given the difficulty of directly monitoring forest characteristics and total bird diversity over large landscapes, consistent monitoring of sensitive woodpecker species can provide answers to both. Further, as woodpeckers are moderately common and conspicuous birds, areas with high woodpecker diversity can be easily identified and prioritised for conservation.},

  abstract = {Rural populations in developing countries depend on forests for fuelwood, fodder and other non-timber forest products. Such dependence has significant effects on faunal diversity and composition, primarily due to alteration of vegetation structure. While earlier studies have assessed the consequences of extractive activities for forest fauna, very few simultaneously acknowledge the role of landscape context, which includes agricultural land-uses and managed forests. This study was carried out in oak-dominated forests located in the middle elevations of the Western Himalayas to investigate effects of extractive activities on avifaunal communities, taking into account the role of landscape composition. Birds were sampled at 74 sites, six times each, over two seasons using fixed-radius point counts. We analysed avian species richness, abundance, composition and guild abundances (based on foraging and habitat preference) as a function of vegetation structure and proportion of dense oak forest around each site. Our results suggest that extractive activities in forests can result in reduced species richness, abundance and altered composition of forest avifauna, brought about by changes in vegetation structure. We also find that these effects may be intensified by the loss of dense oak forests in the landscape. Insectivorous birds and forest specialists were most sensitive to extractive activities and landscape composition. Decreasing canopy cover and proportion of oak forest in the landscape had strong negative effects on insectivorous and forest specialist species. Other local factors such as vertical stratification and understory density also had effects on these avian guilds. Our study indicates that in order to conserve bird species in an increasingly human-dominated landscape of the Western Himalayas, it may be necessary to control extractive activities that affect forest structure as well as retain protected forest stands within a continuum of harvested forest and agricultural landscapes.},

The wearing of face masks, widely adopted to prevent pathogen transmission, represents a novel element in many parts of the world where wearing a face mask was rare before the COVID-19 outbreak. During September 2020\textendash March 2021, we conducted large-scale multi-species field experiments to evaluate whether face mask-use in public places elicits a behavioural response in birds by comparing their escape and alert responses when approached by a researcher with or without a face mask in four European countries (Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, and Poland) and Israel. We also tested whether these patterns differed between urban and rural sites. We employed Bayesian generalized linear mixed models (with phylogeny and site as random factors) controlling for a suite of covariates and found no association between the face mask-wear and flight initiation distance, alert distance, and fly-away distance, respectively, neither in urban nor in rural birds. However, we found that all three distances were strongly and consistently associated with habitat type and starting distance, with birds showing earlier escape and alert behaviour and longer distances fled when approached in rural than in urban habitats and from longer initial distances. Our results indicate that wearing face masks did not trigger observable changes in antipredator behaviour across the Western Palearctic birds, and our data did not support the role of habituation in explaining this pattern.},

Theory also predicts that predators feeding on predators, or intraguild predation, will weaken trophic cascades. Although past syntheses have confirmed cascading effects of terrestrial arthropod predators, we lack a comprehensive analysis for vertebrate insectivores\textemdash which by virtue of their body size and feeding habits are often top predators in these systems\textemdash and of how intraguild predation mediates trophic cascade strength. We report here on a meta-analysis of 113 experiments documenting the effects of insectivorous birds, bats, or lizards on predaceous arthropods, herbivorous arthropods, and plants. Although vertebrate insectivores fed as intraguild predators, strongly reducing predaceous arthropods (38\%), they nevertheless suppressed herbivores (39\%), indirectly reduced plant damage (40\%), and increased plant biomass (14\%). Furthermore, effects of vertebrate insectivores on predatory and herbivorous arthropods were positively correlated. Effects were strongest on arthropods and plants in communities with abundant predaceous arthropods and strong intraguild predation, but weak in communities depauperate in arthropod predators and intraguild predation. The naturally occurring ratio of arthropod predators relative to herbivores varied tremendously among the studied communities, and the skew to predators increased with site primary productivity and in trees relative to shrubs. Although intraguild predation among arthropod predators has been shown to weaken herbivore suppression, we find this paradigm does not extend to vertebrate insectivores in these communities. Instead, vertebrate intraguild preda-tion is associated with strengthened trophic cascades, and insectivores function as dominant predators in terrestrial plant-arthropod communities.},

Foliage arthropod densities were greatest in the forest understory in all four seasons, but understory vegetation density was greatest in gaps. Foliage-gleaning bird abundance was positively associated with foliage-dwelling arthropods during the breeding (F {$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$} 18.5, P \&lt; 0.001) and post-breeding periods (F {$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$} 9.4, P {$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$} 0.004), and negatively associated with foliage-dwelling arthropods during fall migration (F {$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$} 5.4, P {$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$} 0.03). Relationships between birds and arthropods were inconsistent, but the arthropod prey base seemed to be least important during migratory periods. Conversely, bird captures were positively correlated with understory vegetation density during all four periods (P \&lt; 0.001). Our study suggests high bird abundance associated with canopy gaps during the non-breeding period resulted less from high arthropod food resource availability than from complex understory and midstory vegetation structure.}

We captured birds in forest-canopy gaps and adjacent mature forest during 2001 and 2002 at the Savannah River Site in Barnwell County, South Carolina, and flushed their crops to gather information about arthropods eaten during four periods: spring migration, breeding, postbreeding, and fall migration. Arthropod availability for foliage- and ground-gleaning birds was examined by leaf clipping and pitfall trapping. Coleopterans and Hemipterans were used by foliage- and ground-gleaners more than expected during all periods, whereas arthropods in the orders Araneae and Hymenoptera were used as, or less than, expected based on availability during all periods. Ground-gleaning birds used Homopterans and Lepidopterans in proportions higher than availability during all periods. Arthropod use by birds was consistent from spring through fall migration, with no apparent seasonal shift in diet. Based on concurrent studies, heavily used orders of arthropods were equally abundant or slightly less abundant in canopy gaps than in the surrounding mature forest, but bird species were most frequently detected in gaps. Such results suggest that preferential feeding on arthropods by foliage-gleaning birds in gap habitats reduced arthropod densities or, alternatively, that bird use of gap and forest habitat was not determined by food resources. The abundance of arthropods across the stand may have allowed birds to remain in the densely vegetated gaps where thick cover provides protection from predators.},

Plant diversity had a positive effect on aphids, but only in the presence of mutualistic ants, leading to a threefold greater number of both groups in the tri-specific cultures than in monocultures. Plant diversity increased ant abundance not only by increasing aphid number, but also by increasing ant recruitment per aphid. The positive effect of diversity on ants in turn cascaded down to increase plant performance; diversity increased plant growth (but not biomass), and this effect was stronger in the presence of ants. Consequently, bottom-up effects of diversity within the same genus and guild of plants, and top-down effects from the third trophic level (predatory ants), interactively increased plant performance.},

  abstract = {The enemies hypothesis states that reduced insect herbivory in mixed-species stands can be attributed to more effective top\textendash down control by predators with increasing plant diversity. Although evidence for this mechanism exists for invertebrate predators, studies on avian predation are comparatively rare and have not explicitly tested the effects of diversity at different spatial scales, even though heterogeneity at macro- and micro-scales can influence bird foraging selection. We studied bird predation in an established forest diversity experiment in SW Finland, using artificial larvae installed on birch, alder and pine trees. Effects of tree species diversity and densities on bird predation were tested at two different scales: between plots and within the neighbourhood around focal trees. At the neighbourhood scale, birds preferentially foraged on focal trees surrounded by a higher diversity of neighbours. However, predation rates did not increase with tree species richness at the plot level and were instead negatively affected by tree height variation within the plot. The highest probability of predation was observed on pine, and rates of predation increased with the density of pine regardless of scale. Strong tree species preferences observed may be due to a combination of innate bird species preferences and opportunistic foraging on profitable-looking artificial prey. This study therefore finds partial support for the enemies hypothesis and highlights the importance of spatial scale and focal tree species in modifying trophic interactions between avian predators and insect herbivores in forest ecosystems.},

How is the stochastic evolution of molecular biological systems shaped by natural selection? Here, we derive a theorem on the fitness flux in a population, defined as the selective effect of its genotype frequency changes. The fitness-flux theorem generalizes Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection to evolutionary processes including mutations, genetic drift, and time-dependent selection. It shows that a generic state of populations is adaptive evolution: there is a positive fitness flux resulting from a surplus of beneficial over deleterious changes. In particular, stationary nonequilibrium evolution processes are predicted to be adaptive. Under specific nonstationary conditions, notably during a decrease in population size, the average fitness flux can become negative. We show that these predictions are in accordance with experiments in bacteria and bacteriophages and with genomic data in Drosophila. Our analysis establishes fitness flux as a universal measure of adaptation in molecular evolution.},

Numerous experimental studies present data on foraging decisions in captive Great Tits. Little is, however, known about prey selection in the field in relation to the food available and the consequences this has for the food delivery rate to nestlings. Since the foraging performance of the parents is one of the main determinants of fledging weight and juvenile survival, foraging behaviour is an important part of Great Tit reproduction. During the early breeding season up to 75\% of the prey biomass delivered to the nestlings were spiders, which is in contrast with other studies. Only when caterpillars reached a size of 10\textendash 12 mg (approximately the average size of the spiders caught at that time) did the Great Tits change their preferences and 80\textendash 90\% of the delivered prey masses were caterpillars, as reported by other authors. This `switching' between prey occurred within a few days. It was not related to the changes in abundance but to size of caterpillars. The rate at which caterpillars were delivered to the nestlings (in mg/nestling/h) was strongly correlated with the caterpillar biomass available (in mg/m of branches) and nestling growth rate was significantly influenced by the mass of available caterpillars.

These indices can show considerable variation in response to changes in landscape richness and evenness. However, the possibility of encountering opposite trends in the responses of these indices to assemblages that differ in only a single component of diversity has not been sufficiently acknowledged. An opposite response of these indices was observed for two Indian landscapes with the same richness, differing only in evenness. Using a numerical simulation, the likelihood of encountering landscapes with an opposite response was demonstrated to increase with increasing richness, from about 4\% for landscapes consisting of three cover types, to about 6\% for ten types. This emphasizes the need for caution when choosing an index of landscape diversity. Rare cover types provide habitats for sensitive species and facilitate critical ecological processes. The Shannon index, sensitive to their presence, is therefore recommended for landscape management within an ecological framework. Simpson's index, more responsive to the dominant cover type, can be used for specific situations where the dominant cover type is of interest, such as single-species reserve design.},

  abstract = {Nest predation often is reported to be the major cause of nest failure in birds and by extension the predominant influence on annual fecundity. However, other factors such as the ability of some individuals to renest after a failed nest or to lay additional clutches after successful ones, both of which may in turn be influenced by food availability, can also contribute to individual fecundity. We evaluated the relative importance of nest predation, multiple brooding, renesting, and food availability on mean annual fecundity of a migratory songbird population, using AICc from multiple regression models. In a 16-yr study of black-throated blue warblers Dendroica caerulescens, these four variables combined explained 87\% of the annual variance in fecundity. Individually, however, food abundance explained more of the variability (35\%) than did predation (29\%), double-brooding (19\%), or renesting (15\%). These results suggest that measuring food availability may be essential to understanding annual differences in reproductive output. They also demonstrate that failing to account for the contribution of food availability, renesting, and multiple brooding in studies of avian demography can result in serious underestimates of mean annual fecundity, potentially biasing calculations of population growth rate, source-sink dynamics, habitat quality, or population viability.},

Large-scale community science programs like eBird may improve our ability to monitor bird populations, particularly in tropical regions where formal studies are lacking. Here, we estimated population trends for nearly 9000 bird species using global eBird birdwatching data and compared our trends to the population trends designated by BirdLife International. We calculated the rate of agreement between eBird and BirdLife trends and examined the effects of latitudinal affiliation, threat status, number of eBird checklists, eBird trend, BirdLife trend and BirdLife trend derivation on the rate of agreement. We also used a randomization approach to compare observed rates of agreement with the rates of agreement expected by chance alone. We show that the rate of agreement was marginally better than expected by chance and improved significantly for temperate region species of Least Concern with more checklists, and species that eBird or BirdLife identified as increasing. Our results suggest that eBird data are not currently adequate for monitoring populations of the majority of the world's bird species, especially in the developing world where systematic surveys are essential. Increased local participation in community science initiatives like eBird may improve our ability to effectively monitor species. Furthermore, it is important to assess the accuracy of BirdLife trends and the manner in which they are derived, especially for species where BirdLife and eBird data trends disagree.},

We begin by discussing patterns in microbial biogeography and then describe four basic processes (diversification, dispersal, selection, and drift) that contribute to community assembly. We also discuss different combinations of these processes and where and when they may be most important for shaping microbial communities. The spatial and temporal scales of microbial community assembly are also discussed in relation to assembly processes. Throughout this review paper, we highlight differences between microbes and macroorganisms and generate hypotheses describing how these differences may be important for community assembly. We end by discussing the implications of microbial assembly processes for ecosystem function and biodiversity.},

Progressing northward up the east side of the continent, the proportion of breeding species that moves south for the winter increases steadily, from 12\% at 25\textdegree N (southern Florida) to 87\% at 80\textdegree N (Ellesmere Island), a mean increase of 1.4\% for every degree of latitude. Conversely, the proportion of wintering species that moves north for the summer decreases with latitude, from 52\% at 25\textdegree N to none at 70\textdegree N, a mean decrease of 1.1\% for every degree of latitude. These relationships hold despite the fact that 24\% of all species breeding in eastern North America leave the area completely in fall to winter south of 25\textdegree N, mostly in Central and South America (including the Caribbean Islands). These trends are similar to those in western Europe, but at any given latitude an average of 17\% more breeding species leave for the winter in eastern North America, and 10\% more wintering species leave for the summer. This difference is attributed to climate, in that at any given latitude temperatures are cooler in eastern North America than in Europe. We argue that relationships between migration and latitude exist because latitude is a good surrogate measure of factors likely to more directly influence migration, such as climate and daylength, which in turn control the amplitude of seasonal changes in food supplies.},

Aims To test the sample sizes necessary to derive regional population figures and to explore the precision, accuracy and bias of the results. Methods As a case study, distance sampling methodology was applied to transect survey data from the ornithological recording area of Cheshire and Wirral (England), which constitutes about 1\% of UK land area. We used data from 109 transects, either surveyed through the UK Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) in 2004 or 2005 or from a project in 2005 to monitor farms in the Entry Level Stewardship Scheme (ELS); this is 1 in 23 of the 1-km squares in the region. Results There were sufficient observations to fit robust detection functions and produce regional-scale population estimates for 61 species \textendash{} half of the 122 regularly breeding species. Population estimates were further derived for another 16 less common species by applying a detection function from a more common surrogate species. However, some of these population estimates are not considered to be accurate, as judged by local knowledge, the species' distribution shown by a recent tetrad-scale atlas, and as a proportion of the national figures calculated from the national BBS data. The most precise estimates are for species that are evenly distributed across the study area, with decreasing precision for those with a more clumped distribution or species occurring in restricted habitats. Conclusion The present study highlights the potential of these methods and national bird monitoring data for deriving population estimates for many species at a smaller regional scale.},

  abstract = {Estimating the predictability of evolution Evolution results from expected effects, such as selection driving alleles toward fixation, and stochastic effects, such as unusual environmental variation and genetic drift. To determine the potential to predict evolutionary change, Nosil et al. examined three naturally occurring morphs of stick insects (see the Perspective by Reznick and Travis). They wanted to determine which selective parameters could be used to foresee changes, despite varying environmental conditions. One morph fit a model of negative frequency-dependent selection, likely owing to predation, but changes in other morph frequencies remained unpredictable. Thus, for specific cases, we can forecast short-term changes within populations, but evolution is more difficult to predict when it involves a balance between multiple selective factors and uncertainty in environmental conditions. Science, this issue p. 765; see also p. 738 Predicting evolution remains difficult. We studied the evolution of cryptic body coloration and pattern in a stick insect using 25 years of field data, experiments, and genomics. We found that evolution is more difficult to predict when it involves a balance between multiple selective factors and uncertainty in environmental conditions than when it involves feedback loops that cause consistent back-and-forth fluctuations. Specifically, changes in color-morph frequencies are modestly predictable through time (r2 = 0.14) and driven by complex selective regimes and yearly fluctuations in climate. In contrast, temporal changes in pattern-morph frequencies are highly predictable due to negative frequency-dependent selection (r2 = 0.86). For both traits, however, natural selection drives evolution around a dynamic equilibrium, providing some predictability to the process. Frequencies of stick insect coloration and patterning over time are used to determine the predictability of evolution. Frequencies of stick insect coloration and patterning over time are used to determine the predictability of evolution.},

We videotaped the responses of freely foraging dragonflies (Libellula luctuosa and Sympetrum vicinum\textemdash Odonata, suborder Anisoptera) to beads ranging from 0.5 mm to 8 mm in diameter, recording whether or not the dragonflies took off after the beads, and if so, at what distance. Our results indicated that dragonflies were highly selective for bead size. Furthermore, the smaller Sympetrum preferred beads of smaller size and the larger Libellula preferred larger beads. Each species rejected beads as large or larger than their heads, even when the beads subtended the same visual angles as the smaller, attractive beads. Since bead size cannot be determined without reference to distance, we conclude that dragonflies are able to estimate the distance to potential prey items. The range over which they estimate distance is about 1 m for the larger Libellula and 70 cm for the smaller Sympetrum. The mechanism of distance estimation is unknown, but it probably includes both stereopsis and the motion parallax produced by head movements.},

In this study, I compared the odonate assemblages of a natural tropical rainforest and a modified forest in order to assess the loss that could result from human forest alteration. I collected odonates and recorded habitat use at both study sites for several weeks. The assemblages were compared with similarity indices, and total species richness was estimated using a jackknife procedure. The natural forest community, with 61 species, had both a higher diversity and evenness than the village community, with 38 species. Altogether I found 78 species of 13 families, of which 21 were shared between the two areas. Among the families with more than one species, Megapodagrionidae and Libellulidae had the highest similarity between the two sites, whereas Coenagrionidae and Platycnemididae had fairly dissimilar community composition. Three families occurred only in the natural forest. The most important habitats in the village were open sunny areas, artificial ditches, and small permanent creeks, compared to most running waters and the forest interior in the natural forest. Based on habitat preferences in the natural forest, species inhabiting temporary water sources under closed canopy rainforests are most vulnerable to forest modification. They comprised a third of the forest community, and I estimate that approximately 25\% of natural rainforest species will disappear following humaninduced forest alteration.},

  abstract = {I sampled odonates in pristine lower montane rainforest in Papua New Guinea over several months, recording habitat characteristics for all encounters with adult odonates. Using ordination techniques such as cluster analysis and canonical correspondence analysis I then classified the odonate fauna into assemblages correlated with environmental factors. Within the 2.5 km2 study area I found 61 species and a very high ratio of Zygoptera vs Anisoptera. Cluster analysis identified seven distinct assemblages associated with permanent rivers and creeks, temporary streams, puddles, or permanent standing water. Shading, water speed and water permanence were important factors distinguishing the assemblages. Anisoptera were absent from three habitats in the forest interior with temporary water sources. Species associated with temporary water sources and other microhabitats in the forest interior are presumed to be reliant on the high and aseasonal rainfall and the humid conditions of the rainforest. These species are likely to be very intolerant towards deforestation or other disturbance, and should be regarded as indicators for intact rainforest ecosystems. 40\% of all species were considered as rare, and local endemism might be high, further stressing the importance of intact rainforest for the survival of many species of Odonata.},

  abstract = {Quantitative data are essential for many aspects of ecological research. Several methods exist to quantify odonate abundance, but complications may arise when abundances in different habitats need to be compared. In this study, I explored a technique that can overcome the variable detectability of odonates in habitats with different visibility. Distance sampling is briefly introduced and the main assumptions are listed. I conducted line transect surveys using distance sampling protocol over several weeks in a rainforest locality in Papua New Guinea to assess the usefulness of distance sampling. The results suggested that estimates of encounter rate and density of odonates are substantially higher when distance sampling is employed. Density in habitats with poor visibility, like the forest interior, is severely underestimated by traditional sampling methods, and this can lead to a misclassification of habitats. Distance sampling is a very useful technique for quantitative odonate sampling, but the sampling effort required for precise estimates is very high. For the rainforest locality in this study at least 15 months of intensive sampling would be required. Further limitations of distance sampling are discussed.},

  abstract = {Territories of birds, usually defended against conspecific individuals, are sometimes defended against individuals of other species. Since such behavior is demanding both of time and energy, natural selection should favor ecological should favor ecological divergence, the establishment of overlapping territories, and the reduction of aggression. Lack of divergence in modes of exploitation could mean that insufficient time has elapsed for the changes to be completed or that the environment imposes some limitation preventing the evolution of the required degree of divergence. Such environmental limitation can be predicted in (a) structurally simple environments, (b) when feeding sites are strongly stratified in structurally complex vegetation, or (c) when the presence of other species in the environment prevents divergence in certain directions. The known cases of interspecific territoriality in birds are analyzed and shown to be largely in accordance with these predictions, although several cases of overlapping territories in situations where interspecific territoriality has been predicted provide relationships worthy of further study. We suggest that Darwinian selection at the level of the individual permits an understanding of the known structure of avian communities and that there is no need at present to invoke new selective mechanisms at the level of the community or ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Background: Different strategies to search and detect prey may place specific demands on sensory modalities. We studied visual field configuration, degree of eye movement, and orbit orientation in three diurnal raptors belonging to the Accipitridae and Falconidae families. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used an ophthalmoscopic reflex technique and an integrated 3D digitizer system. We found inter-specific variation in visual field configuration and degree of eye movement, but not in orbit orientation. Redtailed Hawks have relatively small binocular areas (,33u) and wide blind areas (,82u), but intermediate degree of eye movement (,5u), which underscores the importance of lateral vision rather than binocular vision to scan for distant prey in open areas. Cooper's Hawks' have relatively wide binocular fields (,36u), small blind areas (,60u), and high degree of eye movement (,8u), which may increase visual coverage and enhance prey detection in closed habitats. Additionally, we found that Cooper's Hawks can visually inspect the items held in the tip of the bill, which may facilitate food handling. American Kestrels have intermediate-sized binocular and lateral areas that may be used in prey detection at different distances through stereopsis and motion parallax; whereas the low degree eye movement (,1u) may help stabilize the image when hovering above prey before an attack. Conclusions: We conclude that: (a) there are between-species differences in visual field configuration in these diurnal raptors; (b) these differences are consistent with prey searching strategies and degree of visual obstruction in the environment (e.g., open and closed habitats); (c) variations in the degree of eye movement between species appear associated with foraging strategies; and (d) the size of the binocular and blind areas in hawks can vary substantially due to eye movements. Inter-specific variation in visual fields and eye movements can influence behavioral strategies to visually search for and track prey while perching.},

The region is bisected by Wallace's line and supports a rich Oriental fauna to the west (Sundaland) and mainly Australian elements to the east. Taxonomic studies throughout the region were greatly advanced in the first part of the last century by M.A. Lieftinck especially, but many areas remain totally unexplored. Present knowledge suggests ca 700 species occur in the region of which ca 500 are endemic. Many species are known from limited material, often a single specimen or a type series from a poorly defined locality. It is certain that many are highly stenotopic and sometimes occur naturally at low abundance. The most critical habitats are mixed-dipterocarp terra firma forests and fresh-water swamp forests, both of which exhibit high a and f3 diversity and harbour a majority of stenotopic species. However all potentially critical species must presently be classified as data deficient. On present knowledge it is not possible to recommend specific action against any species or habitat. No red listings are appropriate. There is an acute need for baseline data, especially from Central Borneo. Wholesale, unregulated habitat destruction for short-term profit poses the gravest threat to the region. Formerly well-studied areas such as Java are in urgent need of reassessment.},

  abstract = {Understanding the ecological mechanisms that underlie extinction is fundamental to conservation. It is well established that not all taxa are equally vulnerable to extinction, but the reasons for these differences are poorly understood. This may be, in part, because different taxa are threatened by different mechanisms. Theoretically, sources of extinction risk that perturb the balance between fecundity and longevity, such as human persecution and introduced predators, should be particularly hazardous for taxa that have slow rates of population growth. In contrast, sources of extinction risk that reduce niche availability, such as habitat loss, should represent a particular threat to taxa that are ecologically specialized. Here we test these predictions by using a phylogenetic comparative method and a database on 95 families of birds. As theory predicts, extinction risk incurred through persecution and introduced predators is associated with large body size and long generation time but is not associated with degree of specialization, whereas extinction risk incurred through habitat loss is associated with habitat specialization and small body size but not with generation time. These results demonstrate the importance of considering separately the multiple mechanisms that underlie contemporary patterns of extinction. They also reveal why it has previously proven so difficult to identify simple ecological correlates of overall extinction risk.},

Adult forest-ground species showed a decrease in abundance in all habitats during the post-breeding period, but hatching-year birds of one of the two forest-ground species were most abundant in early-successional forest during this time. Adults of the two forest-canopy species tended to increase in abundance in 3- to 4-year-old forest from breeding season to post-breeding season. During the breeding season, some forest species were detected with mist-nets in the two early-successional habitats, but infrequently or not at all with point counts in those habitats. Forest birds captured in early-successional habitats during the breeding season may have been nonbreeding floaters, or may have been foraging there from nearby territories in mature forest. Dense shrubs or young trees in early-successional forest may provide habitat for nonbreeding and post-breeding forest migrant songbirds in the Missouri Ozarks.},

Repeated population surveys showed that the rate of decline was so rapid that elevated mortality of adult birds must be a key demographic mechanism. Post mortem examination showed that the majority of dead vultures had visceral gout, due to kidney damage. The realisation that diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug potentially nephrotoxic to birds, had become a widely used veterinary medicine led to the identification of diclofenac poisoning as the cause of the decline. Surveys of diclofenac contamination of domestic ungulate carcasses, combined with vulture population modelling, show that the level of contamination is sufficient for it to be the sole cause of the decline. Testing on vultures of meloxicam, an alternative NSAID for livestock treatment, showed that it did not harm them at concentrations likely to be encountered by wild birds and would be a safe replacement for diclofenac. The manufacture of diclofenac for veterinary use has been banned, but its sale has not. Consequently, it may be some years before diclofenac is removed from the vultures' food supply. In the meantime, captive populations of three vulture species have been established to provide sources of birds for future reintroduction programmes.}

Stopover sites after such extended barriers where birds can rest, refuel, and find shelter from adverse weather, are of crucial importance for the outcome of their migration. Stopover habitat selection used by migrating birds depends on landscape context, habitat patch characteristics, as well as on the particular energetic conditions and needs of individual birds, but it is still poorly investigated. We focused on a long-distance migrating passerine, the woodchat shrike, in order to investigate for the first time the species' habitat selection at a spring stopover site (island of Antikythira, Greece) after the crossing of the Sahara Desert and Mediterranean Sea. We implemented radio-tracking, color-ringing, and visual behavioral observations to collect data on microhabitat use. Generalized Linear Mixed Models were developed to identify the species' most preferred microhabitat during its stopover on this low human disturbed island. We found that high maquis vegetation surrounded by low vegetation was chosen as perches for hunting. Moreover, high maquis vegetation appeared to facilitate hunting attempts toward the ground, the most frequently observed foraging strategy. Finally, we discuss our findings in the context of conservation practices for the woodchat shrike and their stopover sites on Mediterranean islands.},

  abstract = {Many species of Nearctic landbirds exhibit behavioral plasticity during migration, presumably to compensate for energetic demands of migratory flight. At Block Island, Rhode Island, a northern temperate site, I quantified the extent of one form of behavioral plasticity in Nearctic landbirds: dietary expansion from breeding season insectivory to high levels of frugivory during autumn. I also measured changes in energetic condition of migrants using recapture methods and diurnal regressions of mass change. Based on analyses of 1,568 fecal samples collected from 1993-1995, frugivory during migration was frequent within many species, extensive within individual birds, and widespread among taxa. Migratory species ranged from strict insectivory in the Winter Wren (Troglodytes troglodytes) to 96\% fruit by volume in the fecal samples of Rose-breasted Grosbeaks (Pheucticus ludovicianus). Nine of 17 recaptured species demonstrated mass gains between first and last recapture. Only the Red-eyed Vireo (Vireo olivaceus) gained significant mass within a single day, suggesting that the site was suitable for migratory mass gain if a species remained longer than one day. Highly omnivorous species, with greater than one-third of the diet as fruit, gained significantly more mass while on Block Island than did strict insectivores, i.e., species with less than one-third of the diet as fruit. Insectivorous species on average declined in energetic condition during stopover. The extent of frugivory for a species was positively correlated with average change in energetic condition and fat score per day, suggesting that frugivory allowed species to gain mass more efficiently and extensively than exclusive insectivory. I conclude that frugivory in Nearctic landbirds is far more extensive during migration than previously thought, and that dietary plasticity may be an adaptation to energetic demands of migratory flights.},

  abstract = {The Upper Mustang region of Nepal holds important breeding populations of Himalayan Griffon Gyps himalayensis. Despite this species being considered `Least Concern' on the IUCN Red List, the population in Upper Mustang had declined substantially in the early to mid-2000s. During that period, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac was commonly used to treat illness and injury in domesticated ungulates throughout Nepal. The timing and magnitude of declines in Himalayan Griffon in Upper Mustang resemble the declines in resident populations of the `Critically Endangered' White-rumped Vulture Gyps bengalensis and Slender-billed Vulture Gyps tenuirostris in Nepal, both of which are also known to be highly sensitive to diclofenac. Since 2006, the veterinary use of diclofenac has been banned in Nepal to prevent further vulture declines. In this paper, we analyse the population trend in Himalayan Griffon in Upper Mustang between 2002 and 2014 and show a partial recovery. We conclude that the decline is now occurring at a slower rate than previously observed and immigration from areas where diclofenac was either not or rarely used the probable explanation for the recovery observed.},

There is, however, a general absence of knowledge about how far into the future, or other dimensions (space, temperature, phylogenetic distance), useful ecological forecasts can be made, and about how features of ecological systems relate to these distances. The ecological forecast horizon is the dimensional distance for which useful forecasts can be made. Five case studies illustrate the influence of various sources of uncertainty (e.g. parameter uncertainty, environmental variation, demographic stochasticity and evolution), level of ecological organisation (e.g. population or community), and organismal properties (e.g. body size or number of trophic links) on temporal, spatial and phylogenetic forecast horizons. Insights from these case studies demonstrate that the ecological forecast horizon is a flexible and powerful tool for researching and communicating ecological predictability. It also has potential for motivating and guiding agenda setting for ecological forecasting research and development.},

We found good coverage of the country by well-inventoried areas after 2000, but almost no coverage prior to 1980. As such, in before-and-after comparisons documenting effects of global change on Indian birds, the `after' is well documented, but the `before' is lacking. This significant information gap points to the need for digital capture and open sharing of historical information regarding Indian bird species' occurrences; this information will derive in large part from natural history museum specimens, particularly in India and Great Britain, and potentially from older observational data sources and the literature.},

  abstract = {In agroecosystems, biodiversity correlates with ecosystem function, yet mechanisms driving these relationships are often unknown. Examining traits and functional classifications of organisms providing ecosystem functions may provide insight into the mechanisms. Birds are important predators of insects, including pests. However, biological simplification of agroforests may decrease provisioning of this pest removal service by reducing bird taxonomic and functional diversity. A recent meta-analysis of bird exclosure studies from a range of agroecosystems in Central America concluded that higher bird richness is associated with significantly greater arthropod removal, yet the mechanism remains unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis of the same data to examine whether birds demonstrate functional complementarity in tropical agroforests. We classified birds according to relevant traits (body mass, foraging strategy, foraging strata, and diet) and then examined how design of functional classification, including trait selection, classification methods, and the functional diversity metric used affect the suitability of different classifications as predictors of ecosystem services. We determined that vegetation characteristics are not likely drivers of arthropod removal by birds. For some functional classifications, functional richness positively correlated with arthropod removal, indicating that species complementarity may be an important mechanism behind this ecosystem function. The predictive ability of functional classifications increased with the number of traits included in the classification. For the two best classifications examined, functional group richness was a better predictor of arthropod reduction than other metrics of functional diversity (FD and Rao's Q). However, no functional classification predicted arthropod removal better than simple species richness; thus other factors may be important. Our analysis indicates that the sampling effect may also play a role, as one species and two functional groups were responsible for disproportionate effects of arthropod removal.},

I argue that this schizophrenic attitude is the result of lack of appreciation of the full consequences of the peculiarity of the evo-eco sciences as lying in between a-historical disciplines such as physics and completely historical ones as like paleontology. Furthermore, evo-eco researchers have gotten stuck on mathematically appealing but philosophically simplistic concepts such as null hypotheses and p-values defined according to the frequentist approach in statistics, with the consequence of having been unable to fully embrace the complexity and subtlety of the problems with which ecologists and evolutionary biologists deal with. I review and discuss some literature in ecology, philosophy of science and psychology to show that a more critical methodological attitude can be liberating for the evo-eco scientist and can lead to a more fecund and enjoyable practice of ecology and evolutionary biology. With this aim, I briefly cover concepts such as the method of multiple hypotheses, Bayesian analysis, and strong inference.}

The magnitude of interactions such as insectivory, in turn, have been determined by species' richness and abundance in an ecosystem. Therefore, insectivory can vary in function of the plantation's complexity, and thereby, decrease chance of plantations damage due to herbivorous insects. Through an experimental procedure, the insect larvae mortality risk in pine plantations with different degree of structural complexity was measured, together with the herbivory levels on Aristotelia chilensis related to each plantation type. Attacks to artificial caterpillars were significantly greater and herbivory significantly less in structurally complex plantations, where we found higher woody species richness and abundance and a greater understory development, compared to simple plantations. These results suggest that insectivory does vary in function of the structural complexity within forestry plantations, and it is greater in those with higher species diversity, mediating a trophic cascade effect over vegetation, significantly diminishing herbivory. Therefore, forestry plantations should be managed into more structurally complex ones in order to allow a win\textendash win scenario, where maintaining a greater biodiversity increases the provision of useful ecosystem services for these plantations.},

Citizen science represents a diverse range of approaches, but until now this diversity has not been quantitatively explored. We conducted a systematic internet search and discovered 509 environmental and ecological citizen science projects. We scored each project for 32 attributes based on publicly obtainable information and used multiple factor analysis to summarise this variation to assess citizen science approaches. We found that projects varied according to their methodological approach from `mass participation' (e.g. easy participation by anyone anywhere) to `systematic monitoring' (e.g. trained volunteers repeatedly sampling at specific locations). They also varied in complexity from approaches that are `simple' to those that are `elaborate' (e.g. provide lots of support to gather rich, detailed datasets). There was a separate cluster of entirely computer-based projects but, in general, we found that the range of citizen science projects in ecology and the environment showed continuous variation and cannot be neatly categorised into distinct types of activity. While the diversity of projects begun in each time period (pre 1990, 1990\textendash 99, 2000\textendash 09 and 2010\textendash 13) has not increased, we found that projects tended to have become increasingly different from each other as time progressed (possibly due to changing opportunities, including technological innovation). Most projects were still active so consequently we found that the overall diversity of active projects (available for participation) increased as time progressed. Overall, understanding the landscape of citizen science in ecology and the environment (and its change over time) is valuable because it informs the comparative evaluation of the `success' of different citizen science approaches. Comparative evaluation provides an evidence-base to inform the future development of citizen science activities.},

This paper reports results from the latest in a series of road transect surveys conducted across northern, central, western and north-eastern India since the early 1990s. Results from the seven comparable surveys now available were analysed to estimate recent population trends. Populations of all three species of vulture remained at a low level. The previously rapid decline of White-rumped Vulture has slowed and may have reversed since the ban on veterinary use of diclofenac in India in 2006. A few thousand of this species, possibly up to the low tens of thousands, remained in India in 2015. The population of Indian Vulture continued to decline, though probably at a much slower rate than in the 1990s. This remains the most numerous of the three species in India with about 12,000 individuals in 2015 and a confidence interval ranging from a few thousands to a few tens of thousands. The trend in the rarest species, Slender-billed Vulture, which probably numbers not much more than 1,000 individuals in India, cannot be determined reliably.}

  abstract = {Citizen-science driven exercises (e.g. bird surveys) and online platforms (e.g. eBird) provide voluminous data on bird occurrence. However, the semi-structured nature of their data collection makes it difficult to compare bird distribution across space and time. Bird atlases are based on standardized surveys and describe the distribution of bird species over a predefined region and have fewer biases, and thus are better suited for use in research. The recently concluded Kerala Bird Atlas (henceforth KBA) is Asia's largest bird atlas in terms of geographical extent, sampling effort and species coverage. The entire state of Kerala was systematically surveyed twice a year during 2015\textendash 20 and over 0.3 million records of 380 species from 25,000 checklists were aggregated. The dataset was filtered and various metrics were estimated. A total of 915 cells were laid out for systematic surveys, of which 888 were surveyed in either or both the seasons \textendash{} dry season (January\textendash March) and wet season (July\textendash September); 27 cells could not be surveyed in either of the seasons due to logistical constraints. However, this variation in sampling effort had a minimal effect on survey completeness. The slope of the species accumulation curve suggested nearcomplete species sampling in over 70\% of the cells. After eliminating nocturnal and pelagic species, data from 361 species were analysed. Species count was higher in the dry season than in the wet season. Species richness (count) and evenness were higher in the northern and central districts than in the southern districts. High elevation regions of the southern Western Ghats were the largest contiguous areas lacking sufficient sampling. We found that most of the endemics were concentrated in the Western Ghats, but threatened species were as likely to occur along the coasts as in the Ghats. The KBA dataset is a valuable resource for testing various ecological hypotheses and suggesting science-backed conservation measures. KBA model could be replicated for similar atlases in other states or biogeographic regions of India.},

The effects of adaptive radiation are often seen4,5,6, but the underlying causes are difficult to disentangle and remain unclear7,8,9. Here we examine directly therole of ecological opportunity and competition in driving genetic diversification. We use the common aerobic bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens10, which evolves rapidly under novel environmental conditions to generate a large repertoire of mutants11,12,13. When provided with ecological opportunity (afforded by spatial structure), identical populations diversify morphologically, but when ecological opportunity is restricted there is no such divergence. In spatially structured environments, the evolution of variant morphs follows a predictable sequence and we show that competition among the newly evolved niche-specialists maintains this variation. These results demonstrate that the elementary processes of mutation and selection alone are suifficient to promote rapid proliferation of new designs and support the theory that trade-offs in competitive ability drive adaptive radiation14,15.},

  abstract = {The new corona virus infection SARS-CoV2 which was later renamed COVID-19 is a pandemic affecting public health. The fear and the constraints imposed to control the pandemic may correspondingly influence leisure activities, such as birding, which is the practice of observing birds based on visual and acoustic cues. Birders are people who carry out birding observations around the globe and contribute to the massive data collection in citizen science projects. Contrasting to earlier COVID-19 studies, which have concentrated on clinical, pathological, and virological topics, this study focused on the behavioral changes of birders. A total of 4484 questionnaire survey responses from 97 countries were received. The questionnaire had an open-ended style. About 85\% of respondents reported that COVID-19 has changed their birding behavior. The most significant change in birdwatchers\&rsquo; behavior was related to the geographic coverage of birding activities, which became more local. People focused mostly on yard birding. In total, 12\% of respondents (n = 542 cases) reported having more time for birding, whereas 8\% (n = 356 cases) reported having less time for birding. Social interactions decreased since respondents, especially older people, changed their birding behavior toward birding alone or with their spouse. Women reported more often than men that they changed to birding alone or with their spouse, and women also reported more often about canceled fieldtrips or society meetings. Respondents from higher developed countries reported that they spend currently more time for birding, especially for birding alone or with their spouse, and birding at local hotspots. Our study suggests that long lockdowns with strict regulations may severely impact on leisure activities. In addition, a temporal and spatial shift in birding due to the pandemic may influence data quality in citizen science projects. As nature-based recreation will be directed more toward nearby sites, environmental management resources and actions need to be directed to sites that are located near the users, e.g., in urban and suburban areas. The results can be applied with caution to other nature-based recreational activities.},

  abstract = {Among the factors that may reduce the predictability of evolution, chaos, characterized by a strong dependence on initial conditions, has received much less attention than randomness due to genetic drift or environmental stochasticity. It was recently shown that chaos in phenotypic evolution arises commonly under frequency-dependent selection caused by competitive interactions mediated by many traits. This result has been used to argue that chaos should often make evolutionary dynamics unpredictable. However, populations also evolve largely in response to external changing environments, and such environmental forcing is likely to influence the outcome of evolution in systems prone to chaos. We investigate how a changing environment causing oscillations of an optimal phenotype interacts with the internal dynamics of an eco-evolutionary system that would be chaotic in a constant environment. We show that strong environmental forcing can improve the predictability of evolution by reducing the probability of chaos arising, and by dampening the magnitude of chaotic oscillations. In contrast, weak forcing can increase the probability of chaos, but it also causes evolutionary trajectories to track the environment more closely. Overall, our results indicate that, although chaos may occur in evolution, it does not necessarily undermine its predictability.},

In naturally treeless riparian areas of South Africa, invasive trees create shade and reduce native vegetation. We hypothesized that most breeding odonates select riparian areas (1) without shade, and (2) with high density and variety of understory perch structures. In two experiments at reservoir shorelines, we varied shade and perch structures. Dragonfly abundances (predominantly Trithemis species) were lower at sites with high (75\%) or moderate (55\%) shade cover than at sites with no shade, and lower at bare sand sites than sites containing stick perches. Perch density and variety (variety of heights and diameters) did not affect dragonfly abundance. These results indicate that shade alone directly reduces dragonfly habitat selection, isolating one aspect of habitat change that can alter insect behaviors.},

  abstract = {Edge effects have been studied for decades because they are a key component to understanding how landscape structure influences habitat quality. However, making sense of the diverse patterns and extensive variability reported in the literature has been difficult because there has been no unifying conceptual framework to guide research. In this review, we identify four fundamental mechanisms that cause edge responses: ecological flows, access to spatially separated resources, resource mapping, and species interactions. We present a conceptual framework that identifies the pathways through which these four mechanisms can influence distributions, ultimately leading to new ecological communities near habitat edges. Next, we examine a predictive model of edge responses and show how it can explain much of the variation reported in the literature. Using this model, we show that, when observed, edge responses are largely predictable and consistent. When edge responses are variable for the same species at the same edge type, observed responses are rarely in opposite directions. We then show how remaining variability may be understood within our conceptual frameworks. Finally, we suggest that, despite all the research in this area, the development of tools to extrapolate edge responses to landscapes has been slow, restricting our ability to use this information for conservation and management.}

Fledglings' mean ({$\pm$} SE) age at dispersal from the natal sites was 32.5 {$\pm$} 0.6 days post hatching. First dispersal sites were located 1.5 {$\pm$} 0.3 km from the natal site. All young joined flocks of juveniles, except three birds that remained solitary. Sixteen birds stayed at the first dispersal site until departure on migration, whereas nine visited additional dispersal sites. On 40 occasions, 15 fledglings moved up to 6 km from their dispersal sites. Before late August, 96.7\% of fledglings' locations occurred in: (1) second growth scrub/deciduous sapling sites located along forest borders and abandoned farms (59.4\%), (2) gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) damaged deciduous forest (24.4\%), and (3) Virginia pine (Pinus virginianus) forest with heavy deciduous understory (12.8\%). Fruiting trees and shrubs used as food sources by juveniles fruit earlier in these habitats. After late August, an increased number of fledgling locations (14.1\%) occurred in mature deciduous or mixed forest, possibly tracking the later fruiting cycles of understory plants in these habitats. Twenty-four of 33 fledglings left the study area in September. Mean age at departure was 81 {$\pm$} 5 days post hatching. We suggest that postfledging movements in Wood Thrushes are keyed by the availability of food resources and the presence of conspecifics, although other factors may play a role. We conclude that successful conservation of migratory species requires protection of habitats used during the postfledging period as well as those used during the nesting portion of the life cycle.},

Five major searching modes are employed by the 11 foliage\textemdash foraging bird species in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire. These are distinguished primarily by the rates and distances moved by the searching birds and by the types and forms of their prey\textemdash attacking maneuvers. These in turn reflect how large an area is scanned, how thoroughly it is searched, and how the bird moves from perch to perch in its search for prey. Mean searching and prey\textemdash attacking flight distances are positively correlated, indicating that birds move just far enough on average to take them into areas they have not previously searched visually. Likewise, birds that move rapidly while searching make significantly more prey attacks per unit time and hence encounter prey more often. Slow searchers scrutinize substrates more thoroughly and seem to take more cryptic and often larger prey. The results suggest that there are limitations on the ways that birds can search for and capture arthropod prey among foliage. We hypothesize that constraints imposed by the structure of the vegetation and by the types and abundances of prey determine the available foraging opportunities. Such habitat parameters may affect, in ecological or evolutionary time, the foraging traits of birds that can successfully exploit a particular habitat, and hence influence the patterns of bird habitat selection and community structure.},

Results: With evidence from genetic, morphometric, song, and plumage data, we show that two songbird lineages endemic to the Western Ghats montane forest each have diversified into multiple distinct species. Historically labeled as single species of widespread Asian genera, these two lineages are highly divergent and do not group with the taxa in which they were previously classified but rather are distinct early divergences in larger Asian clades of flycatchers and babblers. Here we designated two new genera, the Western Ghats shortwings as Sholicola and the laughingthrushes as Montecincla, and evaluated species-limits to reflect distinct units by revising six previously named taxa and describing one novel species. Divergence dating showed that both these montane groups split from their Himalayan relatives during the Miocene, which is coincident with a shift towards arid conditions that fragmented the previously contiguous humid forest across peninsular India and isolated these lineages in the Western Ghats. Furthermore, these two genera showed congruent patterns of diversification across the Western Ghats Sky Islands, coincident with other climatic changes. Conclusion: Our study reveals the existence of two independent endemic radiations in the high montane Western Ghats or Shola Sky Islands with coincident divergence times, highlighting the role of climate in the diversification of these ancient lineages. The endemic and highly divergent nature of these previously unrecognized species underscores the dearth of knowledge about the biogeography of the Asian tropics, even for comparatively well-known groups such as birds. The substantial increase in the diversity of this region underscores the need for more rigorous systematic analysis to inform biodiversity studies and conservation efforts.},

  abstract = {Despite much interest in the conservation of landbirds during migratory stopover periods, relatively few studies have examined spatial and temporal variation in habitat use and identified important habitats for migrating landbirds in North America. We surveyed migrant landbirds in five habitats (mature forest interior, mature forest-agricultural edge, mature suburban forest, mid-successional pole-stage forest, and early successional shrub-saplingstage forest) in central Pennsylvania from late August to early October, 1997\textendash 1999. We used abundances of individual species and migrant guilds, species richness, and fruit availability to assess relative habitat quality for fall migrants and measured structural characteristics associated with migrant habitat use. Of 15 species that differed in abundance among habitats, species that breed in mature forest (n = 10) were typically broadly distributed among habitats during stopover, with highest abundance in edge-dominated forests (forest-agricultural edge and suburban forest) and lowest abundance in pole-stage forests. Mature-forest-breeding migrants also regularly used early successional forests, where as many individuals were recorded as in forest interior. Shrub-sapling-breeding species (n = 5) generally were more narrowly distributed among habitats and were most abundant in early successional and edge-dominated forests. We detected among-year differences in relative use of habitats by mature-forest-breeding species, which suggests that the relative quality of stopover habitats may vary from year to year. Fruit availability was highest in shrub-sapling and forest-agricultural edge habitats and was positively associated with abundance of primary frugivores in all three years, indicating that fruit may be driving habitat selection by that guild. Mature-forest-breeding migrants were positively associated with forests that had more understory vegetation and lower percentage of canopy cover (i.e. more tree-fall gaps), which suggests that migrants selected sites with greater vertical and horizontal habitat heterogeneity. Migrating shrub-sapling-breeding species were positively associated with small-diameter stems (0\textendash 2.5 cm) and negatively associated with percentage of canopy cover (i.e. characteristics of breeding habitats). Consistently high use of mature edge-dominated and early-successional forests by a wide diversity of landbird species during fall stopover indicates the potential importance of those habitats for migratory landbird conservation.},

  abstract = {Riparian zones are among the most threatened natural ecosystems, being greatly affected by land use changes across the world. Working in a savanna landscape in the Central-West region of Brazil, we assessed the responses of damselfy (Odonata) communities to changes on native vegetation extent in riparian zones. We sampled damselflies around 98 streams in a continuous gradient of native vegetation loss (0 to 100\%). We used the Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN) to test whether the damselfly community showed nonlinear responses related to native vegetation loss within buffers of 250 m radius. We collected 1245 individuals of damselflies, representing 31 species. The TITAN identified 16 species with a significant response: 11 species with negative indicators (Z-) and five as positive indicators (Z+) in relation to native vegetation loss. Six species showed evidence of nonlinear response (Z-), at sites with native vegetation loss between 40\% and 60\%. We also used segmented regression analysis with species richness, which showed weak evidence of a threshold located at 54\% of native vegetation loss. Differently of previous studies with other taxonomic groups in forested environments, our results indicate that the variability around the threshold is higher. Under a precaution perspective and given current levels of vegetation loss around streams where the risk of losing species is higher, we reinforce the importance of appropriate landscape management strategies. In order to effectively conserve biodiversity in aquatic-and-terrestrial environments, the native vegetation loss within pastures and agriculture landscapes, should be above the ``zone of increasing risk of impact'' level. According to the current Brazilian Forest Act, riparian forest of at least 30 m wide must be preserved along both sides of each watercourse. In our study 30 m vegetation wide represents only 10\% of the 250 m buffer area. It implies that the current Brazilian Forest Act does not preserve the Cerrado's riparian vegetation and its associated aquatic biodiversity, since the amount of native vegetation loss is below the ``zone of increasing risk of impact'' we detected for damselflies in evaluated landscapes.},

  abstract = {Collards were grown at Ithaca, New York, in two experimental habitats: pure stands and single rows that were bounded on each side by diverse, meadow vegetation. The arthropods associated with these plants were sampled on 20 dates over a 3\textemdash year period. The status of the herbivore species was measured by their rank in biomass in each sample. The two most prominent species, Phyllotreta cruciferae and Pieris rapae, maintained high status throughout the investigation, but another important species, Brevicoryne brassicae, was absent for an entire season. Pit feeders usually formed the most important herbivore guild. Nevertheless, the guild spectrum, which describes the functional structure of the fauna, varied widely in time and space. The size distributions of species and of individuals were both highly skewed toward the smaller sizes. Herbivore loads, the mean biomass of herbivores per 100 g of consumable foliage, were consistently higher in the pure stands. Moreover, herbivore loads varied significantly with season in each experimental habitat. Both the number of herbivore species and the diversity of the herbivore load were greater in the diverse habitat. Biomass was more heavily concentrated among the prominent herbivores in the pure stands; increased dominance, rather than differences in species richness, appeared to be the major cause for the lower herbivore diversity in this habitat. The diversity of predators and parasitoids was higher in the pure stands. Most of the abundant species found on collards shared a similar narrow range of hosts. As a result the species in this core group of herbivores and parasitoids were regularly associated with each other. Predators and the less abundant herbivores tended to be less specialized and served to link the collard association with the surrounding community. Plant\textemdash arthropod associations are representative of component communities, well\textemdash integrated systems that form portions of larger compound communities. This distinction facilitates the analysis of community structure. Microclimates and the effectiveness of 'enemies' did not appear to differ sufficiently in the two experimental habitats to account for the observed differences in the herbivore load. The results suggest a new proposition, the resource concentration hypothesis, which states that herbivores are more likely to find and remain on hosts that are growing in dense or nearly pure stands; that the most specialized species frequently attain higher relative densities in simple environments; and that, as a result, biomass tends to become concentrated in a few species, causing a decrease in the diversity of herbivores in pure stands.},

  abstract = {Contributory citizen science projects (hereafter ``contributory projects'') are a powerful tool for avian conservation science. Large-scale projects such as eBird have produced data that have advanced science and contributed to many conservation applications. These projects also provide a means to engage the public in scientific data collection. A common challenge across contributory projects like eBird is to maintain participation, as some volunteers contribute just a few times before disengaging. To maximize contributions and manage an effective program that has broad appeal, it is useful to better understand factors that influence contribution rates. For projects capitalizing on recreation activities (e.g., birding), differences in contribution levels might be explained by the recreation specialization framework, which describes how recreationists vary in skill, behavior, and motives. We paired data from a survey of birders across the United States and Canada with data on their eBird contributions (n = 28,926) to test whether those who contributed most are more specialized birders. We assigned participants to 4 contribution groups based on eBird checklist submissions and compared groups' specialization levels and motivations. More active contribution groups had higher specialization, yet some specialized birders were not active participants. The most distinguishing feature among groups was the behavioral dimension of specialization, with active eBird participants owning specialized equipment and taking frequent trips away from home to bird. Active participants had the strongest achievement motivations for birding (e.g., keeping a life list), whereas all groups had strong appreciation motivations (e.g., enjoying the sights and sounds of birding). Using recreation specialization to characterize eBird participants can help explain why some do not regularly contribute data. Project managers may be able to promote participation, particularly by those who are specialized but not contributing, by appealing to a broader suite of motivations that includes both appreciation and achievement motivations, and thereby increase data for conservation.\textbullet{} Contributory science projects have conservation and societal benefits, yet some projects struggle with participant retention.\textbullet{} Recreation specialization (a framework that describes individuals' degree of engagement in and commitment to an activity) uses three dimensions to classify recreationists: affective (psychological attachment to specific activities), behavioral (frequency of participation, prior experience, and equipment used), and cognitive (knowledge and skill about an activity).\textbullet{} We used survey data about involvement and preferences of birders in the U.S. and Canada to measure recreation specialization. We then combined these data with respondents' checklist contributions to eBird.\textbullet{} Individuals who had the highest scores for all three recreation specialization dimensions contributed the most checklists to eBird.\textbullet{} Participants motivated by achievement contributed more than those not motivated by achievement. Motivation by appreciation did not influence the number of contributions.},

  abstract = {The study of habitat selection and population interactions has a history about as long as any integrative topic in ecology. Its literature is classically scientific in the sense that it combines pattern discovery, theory, and empirical testing. It is, implicitly, one of the significant demonstrations that general ecological principles exist and can be discovered by hypotheticodeductive methodologies. I outline the development of the topic in the context of two questions, both of which take it as an assumption that habitat selection is an optimal-foraging process. How does habitat selection alter (or reinforce) the dynamics of population interactions? How do those interactions alter the optimal behavior? Competition within a single species forces the use of a wide variety of habitats. This has been shown in many taxa, and Fretwell's theory gives it a sound basis in evolutionary ecology. In other words, we ecologists know that the pattern exists, and we know why it exists. Ecologists are capitalizing on their understanding of single-species habitat selection to design methods for comparing fitnesses (and components of fitnesses) in different habitats. It has been known for 40 yr that a second, competing species can reverse the effects of competition within a species, producing habitat selection where it would not otherwise exist. For the past decade, however, we have been discovering that this effect is really a cluster of effects. Whether competition restores selectivity depends on the kind of competition at work and on the information-gathering abilities of foragers. So does the extent to which it is restored. Generally, the strongest separation of species by habitat selection results from distinct-preference competition between species whose individuals have very limited abilities to assess the density of food in a patch. (This model yields the "ghost of competition past.") But if individuals have much ability to assess food density, there is little or no increase likely in their selectivity compared with the single-species case. Other sorts of competition produce intermediate results. The effects of interspecific competition on habitat selection have been investigated with theory and experiment working closely together. The by-products of the combination have been that new sorts of competitive relationships have been suggested and that it has been possible to compare these relationships with those suggested from other areas of investigation such as plant-herbivore interactions, succession, and plant specializations. Habitat selection may stabilize predation as well as competition. Sih has shown that the conditions required for stabilization closely resemble those predicted by optimal-foraging theory: Victims need to prefer the safer habitat most when their populations are lowest or when their chance of being killed in the riskier habitat is highest. Numerous experiments show that foragers behave appropriately to protect themselves from predation. Multispecies studies emphasize the potential for differential susceptibility and optimal habitat selection to maintain diverse communities. Despite, or perhaps because of, the rich understanding that the study of habitat selection has already engendered, many new and exciting topics are emerging. Perhaps the most challenging is the combination of time scales that allows phenotypes to change morphologically and physiologically as well as behaviorally. It seems probable that investigators interested in these topics will continue to receive substantial payoffs for their efforts.}

  abstract = {Community ecology entered the 1970s with the belief that niche theory would supply a general theory of community structure. The lack of wide-spread empirical support for niche theory led to a focus on models specific to classes of communities such as lakes, intertidal communities, and forests. Today, the needs of conservation biology for metrics of ``ecological health'' that can be applied across types of communities prompts a renewed interest in the possibility of general theory for community ecology. Disputes about the existence of general patterns in community structure trace at least to the 1920s and continue today almost unchanged in concept, although now expressed through mathematical modeling. Yet, a new framework emerged in the 1980s from findings that community composition and structure depend as much on the processes that bring species to the boundaries of a community as by processes internal to a community, such as species interactions and co-evolution. This perspective, termed ``supply-side ecology'', argued that community ecology was to be viewed as an ``organic earth science'' more than as a biological science. The absence of a general theory of the earth would then imply a corresponding absence of any general theory for the communities on the earth, and imply that the logical structure of theoretical community ecology would consist of an atlas of models special to place and geologic time. Nonetheless, a general theory of community ecology is possible similar in form to the general theory for evolution if the processes that bring species to the boundary of a community are analogized to mutation, and the processes that act on the species that arrive at a community are analogized to selection. All communities then share some version of this common narrative, permitting general theorems to be developed pertaining to all ecological communities. Still, the desirability of a general theory of community ecology is debatable because the existence of a general theory suppresses diversity of thought even as it allows generalizations to be derived. The pros and cons of a general theory need further discussion.},

Despite this, very little is known of the wintering ecology of migratory birds. During three winter seasons, we assessed Wilson's Warbler (Cardellina pusilla) density, territory size, and body condition at three cloud forest sites in southeast Mexico, with differing degrees of habitat disturbance and forest cover: preserved 125 ha of cloud forest actively protected for 40 years; moderately disturbed site of 67.5 ha of cloud forest under protection for 29 years; and highly disturbed unprotected site with 6.5 ha of cloud forest. We determined warbler density using 20 unlimited-radius point-counts at each site. We also captured and measured birds (n = 74) over three years, to obtain a body condition index, and re-sighted color-banded birds to determine individual territory size at each site. Bird densities were two times greater and territory size was smaller in the conserved forest site compared to disturbed sites with lower forest cover. However, there was no significant difference among sites in the body condition index of territorial birds. Furthermore, territory size and body condition were relatively constant among years for birds in conserved forest, but exhibited high inter-annual fluctuations at disturbed forest sites. Considering the higher bird density, smaller territory size, and inter-annually consistent body condition at the conserved cloud forest site, we propose that this represents higher quality wintering habitat for Wilson's Warblers.},

Little is known about survival or habitat use of fledglings in their first weeks out of the nest. We radiotracked adult Hooded Warblers (Wilsonia citrina) attending fledglings from large (\&gt;150-ha) and small (\&lt;30-ha) forest fragments during 2002 and 2003. Mark\textendash recapture models were used to assess the effects of forest-fragment size and age of the attending adult on the survival of young. We also examined the structure of nesting- versus postfledging-habitat used by fledglings. Only 19\% of fledgling Hooded Warblers survived the 28-day fledgling period prior to independence, and fledglings' daily survival probability was lowest in the first four days after they left the nest (1\textendash 2 days postfledging: 0.72; 3\textendash 4 days postfledging: 0.69). Fledgling survival did not differ between large and small forest fragments. Large fragments were more likely to contain older adults, and age of parent had a positive influence on fledgling survival, independent of fragment size. As in many other studies, overall productivity was higher within larger fragments; this was largely attributable to differences in number fledged rather than fledgling survival. Habitat used by fledglings was more structurally complex than habitat at nest sites, which indicates that fledglings may seek habitat with high cover to avoid predation. Fledgling survival was much lower than estimates used in demographic models, which suggests that for many species, these models may need re-evaluation.Supervivencia de Volantones de Wilsonia citrina en Fragmentos de Bosque Peque\~nos y Grandes},

  abstract = {Patterns of habitat use by breeding birds were studied in cottonwood riparian forests along 100 km of the South Fork of the Snake River in southeastern Idaho, United States, from 1991 to 1994. A hierarchical approach was used to examine habitat use at three spatial scales: microhabitat (local vegetation characteristics), macrohabitat (cottonwood forest patch characteristics), and landscape (composition and patterning of surrounding [matrix] vegetation types and land uses). This paper addresses a series of predictions about species' distributions that incorporate the different spatial scales. Bird distribution and abundance and vegetation data were collected on 57 cottonwood forest patches ranging in size from 0.40 ha to 205 ha. The surrounding landscape changed from a valley surrounded by mountains, on the upstream end of the study area, to a narrow canyon adjacent to natural upland vegetation in the middle section, and to a wide, open floodplain dominated by agriculture on the downstream end. The best predictors of high species richness (r2 = 0.71) were natural and heterogeneous landscapes, large cottonwood patches, close proximity to other cottonwood patches, and microhabitats with relatively open canopies. Distribution and frequency of occurrence were evaluated for 32 species of small land birds. The most frequent significant predictor of species occurrence was the landscape component: increases in upland natural vegetation with decreases in agriculture. Both interior and edge specialists were found in arid land, cottonwood riparian forests that are linear in nature, with large amounts of edge. Nest predators, brood parasites, and exotic species responded positively to human-altered landscapes. Landscape patterns were the primary influence on distribution and occurrence of most bird species, whereas macrohabitat and microhabitat were of secondary importance. Thus, surrounding landscape (matrix) features should be a primary consideration for selecting riparian reserve areas.},

Change in arrival date in relation to change in NDVI was similar in the two sexes. Change in arrival date significantly and positively predicted change in breeding date.

Although the intensity of nectar exploitation remains unexplored at the community level, it probably varies along environmental gradients.We video-recorded flower visits to animal-pollinated plants in Afrotropical rainforests along a complete elevational gradient in the wet and dry seasons on Mount Cameroon. We analysed how the proportion of nectar robbing and thieving in the communities changes spatiotemporally, especially in association with the floral traits of the flowering plants.We recorded 14,391 flower visits, of which \textasciitilde 4.3\% were from robbers (mostly bees and birds), and \textasciitilde 2.1\% were from thieves (mostly flies, bees, and moths). Of the 194 studied plants, only 29 and 39 were nectar robbed and thieved, respectively. Robbers and thieves were most frequent at mid-elevations, with more frequent robbing in the wet season and thieving in the dry season. These trends were linked to the local composition of floral traits, and cheating groups' associations to particular traits. Floral traits that prevented thieving made flowers susceptible to robbing, and vice versa.Spatiotemporal variation in floral traits across drives the cheating behaviour of flower visitors across communities, while indicating a trade-off between preventing nectar robbing and thieving.},

While busy highways dissecting forested areas create edges which are known to reduce bird densities due to the disturbing effect of noise, the impacts of logging forest roads with low traffic volumes have rarely been studied. In this study, we compared species richness and similarity of canopy, cavity and shrub guilds of birds along low-traffic forest roads, in forest interior, and at forest edges in secondary forests in central Europe, where the forests have passed through extensive changes toward uniformly compact growths dominated by production conifers. Although we found tree diversity as positively affecting bird richness across all habitats, the bird richness along forest roads was higher than in forest interior but lower than along forest edges. The shrub guild of birds along forest roads resembled this guild along forest edges while canopy and cavity guilds at the roads were more similar to these guilds in forest interior. Forest interior had the highest probability for some guild to be absent. We conclude that low-traffic roads lead to increase of habitat heterogeneity in structurally poor forests and attract birds due to additional habitat attributes\textemdash including better light conditions\textemdash that are scarce in forest interior. Therefore, broader support for higher structural diversification of uniform plantations in central European production forests would benefit bird communities inhabiting these areas.},

  abstract = {Previous ecological studies of Palearctic passerine migrants in Africa have claimed to reveal some general features with respect to habitat use, foraging ecology and interspecific relationships with Afrotropical residents. In this review we discuss apparent contradictions between earlier generalisations and more recent results from more detailed field studies and explore in which areas our ecological knowledge and theoretical understanding remain poor and have given rise to misconceptions. For example, it has been claimed that migrants use structurally more diverse and open habitats and that they forage higher and in more peripheral parts of the vegetation than their ecologically similar Afrotropical counterparts, yet in the past these characteristics were often not clearly defined and not always correlated in practice. It has also been stated that migrants are more flexible in habitat use, occupying a wider range of habitat types and employing a higher diversity of foraging techniques, both of which were assumed to be adaptations to permit coexistence with Afrotropical residents by using untapped resources that are only seasonally available. Yet results from studies of the role of competition in shaping migrant-resident communities remain largely unconvincing. While flexibility may facilitate migrant-resident coexistence, it may also favour the evolution of migration because specialists are less able to use their advantages in different environments. We note that definitions of flexibility and specialisation may themselves depend on the ecological or evolutionary approach adopted by researchers. We conclude that few generalisations can safely be made about the ecology of Palearctic migrants in Africa and that adaptive explanations for the behaviours observed are largely lacking, as are studies of the fitness consequences of different migrant strategies such as have been conducted in the Nearctic-Neotropical migration system.},

We examined whether signals from mechanically damaged trees (simulating damage by herbivores) attract predators of insects along a complete elevational rainforest gradient in tropical region, where various predators are expected to occur at particular elevational belts. We studied predation of artificial caterpillars on trees with and without `herbivorous' damage; as well as diversity and abundances of potential predators at eight study sites along the elevational gradient (200\textendash 3700 m a.s.l.). We focused on attacks by ants and birds, as the main predators of herbivorous insect. The predation rate decreased with elevation from 10\% d-1 at 200 m a.s.l. to 1.8\% d-1 at 3700 m a.s.l. Ants were relatively more important predators in the lowlands, while birds became dominant predators above 1700 m a.s.l. Caterpillars exposed on trees with herbivorous damage were attacked significantly more than caterpillars exposed on trees without damage. Results suggest that relative importance of predators varies along elevational gradient, and that observed predation rates correspond with abundances of predators. Results further show that herbivorous damage attracts both ants and birds, but its effect is stronger for ants.},

COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns presented a unique opportunity to disentangle these effects during a period of reduced human activity. We launched a community science project in spring 2020 to explore drivers of site use by and detection of common birds in cities under lockdown in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Our goals were twofold: (1) consider how intensity of urbanization, canopy cover, and availability of bird feeders and bird baths influenced avian habitat use; and (2) quantify how daily changes in weather, air pollution, and human mobility influenced detection of birds. We analyzed 6,640 surveys from 367 volunteers at 429 monitoring sites using occupancy models for 46 study species. Neither land cover nor canopy cover influenced site use by 50\% of study species, suggesting that backyard birds may have used a wider range of habitats during lockdowns. Human mobility affected detection of 76\% of study species, suggesting that birds exhibited species-specific behavioral responses to day-to-day changes in human activity beginning shortly after initial lockdown restrictions were implemented. Our study also showcases how existing community science platforms can be leveraged to support local monitoring efforts.},

  abstract = {The North American Breeding Bird Survey is a roadside, count-based survey conducted by volunteer observers. Begun in 1966, it now is a primary source of information on spatial and temporal patterns of population change for North American birds. We analyze population change for states, provinces, Bird Conservation Regions, and the entire survey within the contiguous United States and southern Canada for 426 species using a hierarchical log-linear model that controls for observer effects in counting. We also map relative abundance and population change for each species using a spatial smoothing of data at the scale of survey routes. We present results in accounts that describe major breeding habitats, migratory status, conservation status, and population trends for each species at several geographic scales. We also present composite results for groups of species categorized by habitats and migratory status. The survey varies greatly among species in percentage of species' range covered and precision of results, but consistent patterns of decline occur among eastern forest, grassland, and aridland obligate birds while generalist bird species are increasing.},

  abstract = {Aim According to the Latitudinal Biotic Interaction Hypothesis (LBIH), the general increase in biodiversity towards lower latitudes can be partially explained by an increase in the intensity of biotic interactions. While LBIH received some support for plant-herbivores interactions, much less is known about how higher trophic levels may contribute to shape biotic interactions across latitudinal gradients. We hypothesized that the diversity of insectivorous birds increases towards lower latitude, leading to higher predation rates on insect herbivores. Location Europe. Taxon Insectivorous birds and pedunculate oaks. Methods We deployed plasticine caterpillars in 138 oak trees in 47 sites along a 19\textdegree{} latitudinal gradient in Europe to quantify bird insectivory through predation attempts. In addition, we used passive acoustic monitoring to (i) characterize the acoustic diversity of surrounding soundscapes; and (ii) infer both taxonomic and functional diversity of insectivorous birds from recordings. Results The functional diversity of insectivorous birds increased towards lower latitude. Bird predation increased with latitude, forest cover and bird acoustic diversity but decreased with mean annual temperature and functional richness of insectivorous birds. Contrary to our predictions, latitudinal clines in bird predation attempts were not directly mediated by changes in insectivorous bird diversity or acoustic diversity, but latitude and habitat still had independent effects on predation attempts. Main conclusions Our study does not fully support the predictions of the LBIH of more biotic interactions southwards and advocates for better accounting for activity and abundance of insectivorous birds when studying the large-scale variation in insect-tree interactions.},

  abstract = {Despite the importance of herbivory for the structure and functioning of species-rich forests, little is known about how herbivory is affected by tree species richness, and more specifically by random vs. non-random species loss. We assessed herbivore damage and its effects on tree growth in the early stage of a large-scale forest biodiversity experiment in subtropical China that features random and non-random extinction scenarios of tree mixtures numbering between one and 24 species. In contrast to random species loss, the non-random extinction scenarios were based on the tree species' local rarity and specific leaf area \textendash{} traits that may strongly influence the way herbivory is affected by plant species richness. Herbivory increased with tree species richness across all scenarios and was unaffected by the different species compositions in the random and non-random extinction scenarios. Whereas tree growth rates were positively related to herbivory on plots with smaller trees, growth rates significantly declined with increasing herbivory on plots with larger trees. Our results suggest that the effects of herbivory on growth rates increase from monocultures to the most species-rich plant communities and that negative effects with increasing tree species richness become more pronounced with time as trees grow larger. Synthesis. Our results indicate that key trophic interactions can be quick to become established in forest plantations (i.e. already 2.5 years after tree planting). Stronger herbivory effects on tree growth with increasing tree species richness suggest a potentially important role of herbivory in regulating ecosystem functions and the structural development of species-rich forests from the very start of secondary forest succession. The lack of significant differences between the extinction scenarios, however, contrasts with findings from natural forests of higher successional age, where rarity had negative effects on herbivory. This indicates that the effects of non-random species loss could change with forest succession.},

Testing the influence of human disturbance would ideally need experimental approach, however, in cities, this is challenging at relevant spatial and temporal scales. Thus, to better understand the ecological effects of human activity, we exploited the opportunity that the city-wide lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic provided during the spring of 2020. We assessed changes in reproductive success of great tits (Parus major) at two urban habitats affected strikingly differently by the `anthropause', and at an unaffected forest site. Our results do not support that urban great tits benefited from reduced human mobility during the lockdown. First, at one of our urban sites, the strongly (-\,44\%) reduced human disturbance in 2020 (compared to a long-term reference period) did not increase birds' reproductive output relative to the forest habitat where human disturbance was low in all years. Second, in the other urban habitat, recreational human activity considerably increased (+\,40\%) during the lockdown and this was associated with strongly reduced nestling body size compared to the pre-COVID reference year. Analyses of other environmental factors (meteorological conditions, lockdown-induced changes in air pollution) suggest that these are not likely to explain our results. Our study supports that intensified human disturbance can have adverse fitness consequences in urban populations. It also highlights that a few months of `anthropause' is not enough to counterweight the detrimental impacts of urbanization on local wildlife populations.},

Yet, there is little systematic information on its avifauna, particularly in the context of the observed impacts of global warming, land use change, forest modification, and fragmentation. In this study, we inventory the birds of this forest association based on intensive field studies carried out at 42 sites (in six geographical clusters) inthe Nainital, and Almora Districts of Uttarakhand, along with collecting data on abundance status, breeding, habitat preferences, and endemism status. We recorded a total of 136 species over four years of study across these sites. Based on our observations, 104 species (76\%) are likely to be breeding. The large number of broad-leaved forest specialists (35), primarily forest species that are relatively adaptable (69), and Himalayan endemics (51) recorded during the study indicates the high conservation value of this forest association. Based on our observations, and the existing literature, we suggest that the 19 Himalayan endemic species that are also oak forest specialists, are likely to be endangered due to the concordant threats of habitat degradation, fragmentation, and climate change.},

Odonata is a potential group of organisms that could indicate these habitat alterations once they have aquatic and terrestrial life forms. In this study, we tested the use of adult odonate individual species and community assemblage measures to evaluate the effect of riparian vegetation cut-off and sewage discharges. The study was performed at Turvo Sujo River, in Vic\c osa, Southern Brazil. We selected twelve sites, six of them were upstream and six were downstream the city. Species abundance and species richness estimates of adult odonates were performed on sunny days during summer and winter. We analyzed the goodnessof-fit of the species abundances to geometric and lognormal series. We also measured the Habitat Physical Integrity Score (HPIS), pasture and forest proportions and physicochemical water parameters at each site. Only few species were abundant in up- and downstream regions. Abundance of Argia modesta was higher at the upstream (t = 3.188; df = 17; p = 0.005) than at the downstream region and this species is a potential habitat bioindicator organisms. Species richness was statistically different only in the wet season and species\textendash abundance relations at the two regions fitted well to both geometric and lognormal series. The lack of riparian vegetation indicates a loss of habitat integrity and heterogeneity at Turvo Sujo River basin, which was mainly dominated by lake-dwelling odonate species. Low species richness differences are caused by species pool biases toward those ones capable to survive at degraded ecosystems, suggesting that the effects of water parameters are much less important than a landscape dominated by pastures and practically without forests. We suggest the use of species\textendash abundance models (like geometric and lognormal series) to determine the degree of impacts over a given community once they are simple models and can show intrinsic processes structuring communities.},

The North American Great Plains includes a forest-grassland ecotone in the southcentral United States that has expanded and contracted in recent decades in response to historical periods of drought and pluvial conditions. This dynamic region also marks a western distributional limit for many passerine birds that typically breed in forests of the eastern United States. To better understand the influence that variability can exert on broad-scale biodiversity, we explored historical longitudinal shifts in the western extent of breeding ranges of eastern forest songbirds in response to the variable climate of the southern Great Plains. We used climatic niche modeling to estimate current distributional limits of nine species of forest-breeding passerines from 30-year average climate conditions from 1980 to 2010. During this time, the southern Great Plains experienced an unprecedented wet period without periodic multi-year droughts that characterized the region's long-term climate from the early 1900s. Species' climatic niche models were then projected onto two historical drought periods: 1952\textendash 1958 and 1966\textendash 1972. Threshold models for each of the three time periods revealed dramatic breeding range contraction and expansion along the forest-grassland ecotone. Precipitation was the most important climate variable defining breeding ranges of these nine eastern forest songbirds. Range limits extended farther west into southern Great Plains during the more recent pluvial conditions of 1980\textendash 2010 and contracted during historical drought periods. An independent dataset from BBS was used to validate 1966\textendash 1972 range limit projections. Periods of lower precipitation in the forest-grassland ecotone are likely responsible for limiting the western extent of eastern forest songbird breeding distributions. Projected increases in temperature and drought conditions in the southern Great Plains associated with climate change may reverse range expansions observed in the past 30 years.},

  abstract = {Predation of herbivorous Lepidoptera larvae by insectivorous avifauna was estimated on Lindera benzoin in edge and interior habitats at two sites in eastern Pennsylvania (USA). Clay baits modeled after Epimecis hortaria (Geometridae) larvae, the primary herbivore of L. benzoin at our study sites, were used to estimate predation by birds. In both habitat types, models were placed on uninjured L. benzoin leaves as well as on leaves that had prior insect herbivore damage. Rates of model attack were greater, and model longevity reduced, in forest edge plots compared to interiors. Naturally occurring herbivore damage on L. benzoin was greater in forest interiors. However, model attack was not significantly greater on leaves with prior herbivory damage, suggesting that birds do not effectively use this type of leaf damage as a cue in their foraging. Our findings are consistent with a contribution of bird predation towards top-down control of herbivory in this system. We further discuss these results in a broader context considering the possible effects of habitat type on leaf quality, leaf defense, and herbivore performance.},

  abstract = {The success of annual migrations for songbirds is greatly affected by habitat quality at stopover sites, particularly in relation to food needed for rapid refueling. The abundance and nutritional quality of important food resources may be linked to the presence of deciduous shrub species that provide seasonal fruits in the fall and support insects in the spring. The objective of this study was to determine whether migrating songbirds benefit from resources provided by native or invasive fruit-bearing shrubs found at 2 bird-banding stations in Rochester, NY. We conducted nutritional analyses (energy density, fat content, total soluble solids) on the fruits of common shrub species at the study sites, monitored removal of the fall fruits of focal native and invasive shrub species in the field, and measured the abundance of midges\textemdash a common insect resource for migrating songbirds\textemdash{} supported by the focal shrub species in the spring. The highest fat content and energy densities were found in fruits of native shrubs, ranging from 6.57 to 48.72\% fat and 18.83 to 28.68 kJ/g of energy. All invasive fruits had {$\leq$}0.99\% fat and {$\leq$}17.17 kJ/g of energy. We also found a significant positive correlation between fat and energy content of the fruits. Native dogwood fruits were consumed by migrating songbirds at higher rates than invasive fruits over the fall migration period. However, there was no clear pattern of midge abundance between native and invasive shrub species during the spring migration period. Our results suggest that fruits of native shrubs are of greater nutritional value to migrating songbirds than the fruits of invasive shrubs during fall migration, which is supported by the higher removal rates by songbirds of native dogwood fruits than fruits of the 4 other invasive fruit species. This finding suggests that removal of invasive fruit-bearing shrubs or plants will not negatively impact migrating birds when high-quality native fruit-bearing shrubs are available. However, additional study on the relative value of these shrubs in the spring and over multiple seasons is needed to provide insight into their overall value for birds during annual migrations.},

Feral pigeons (Columba livia) are widespread and invasive, thus their effective control is of keen international interest. The COVID-19 pandemic has offered an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the impact of a nation-wide Circuit Breaker (restricted human activities) in Singapore on first, the abundance of the feral pigeons and three urban commensals\textemdash the Javan myna (Acridotheres javanicus), common myna (A. tristis), and house crow (Corvus splendens) in different food source types; and second, the activity budgets of feral pigeons. A significant and progressive decline in feral pigeon abundance was observed in open food centres and feeding hotspots after the Circuit Breaker was implemented. While the house crow and common myna were less affected, the Javan myna abundance increased moderately at refuse collection centres during the Circuit Breaker and decreased significantly in green spaces after the Circuit Breaker. Changes in food abundance could also predict changes in feral pigeon abundance and its effect was greatest in feeding hotspots. A greater proportion of feral pigeons was observed foraging and moving with a smaller proportion seen resting with probable consequences on their reproductive capacity. Our study also cautions against drawing inferences on biological responses due to similar social restrictions without careful consideration of other ecological factors, like average flock size and time of the day, which also affected the proportion of pigeons foraging on natural versus anthropogenic food. In summary, our results advocate a food limitation approach to control the feral pigeon populations.},

We determined bird species richness and community composition in windbreaks composed of remnant native vegetation amongst tea plantations (natural windbreaks), and compared it with the surrounding primary forests. Fifty-one, ten-minute point counts were conducted in each habitat type over three days. Despite the limited sampling period, our bird inventories in both natural windbreaks and primary forests were nearly complete, as indicated by bootstrap true richness estimator. Bird species richness and abundance between primary forests and windbreaks were similar, however a difference in bird community composition was observed. Abundances of important functional groups such as frugivores and insectivores did not vary between habitat types but nectarivores were more abundant in windbreaks, potentially as a result of the use of windbreaks as traveling routes, foraging and nesting sites. This preliminary study suggests that natural windbreaks may be important habitats for the persistence of bird species in a production landscape. However, a better understanding of the required physical and compositional characteristics for windbreaks to sustain bird communities is needed for effective conservation management.},

Two kinds of flock participants are recognized: those that join other species (`followers') and are therefore likely to be the recipients of the benefits of flock participation and those that are joined (`leaders'). Through comparative analyses, using a large sample of flocks from around the world, we show that (1) `followers' tend to be smaller, more insectivorous, and feed in higher strata than matched species that participate in flocks to a lesser extent and (2) `leaders' tend to be cooperative breeders more often than matched species that are not known to lead flocks. Furthermore, meta-analyses of published results from across the world showed that bird species in terrestrial mixed-species flocks increase foraging rates and reduce vigilance compared to when they are solitary or in conspecific groups. Moreover, the increase in foraging rates is seen only with flock followers and not flock leaders. These findings suggest a role for predation in the evolution of mixed-species flocking. Species that are vulnerable to predation follow species whose vigilance they can exploit. By doing so, they are able to reduce their own vigilance and forage at higher rates.},

A total of 13 441 ant individuals belonging to 3839 species occurrences and 71 species were collected, of which 26 species were exclusive predators and 45 species were omnivores. 4. Occurrence and species richness of total and omnivore ants were positively related to soil pH. Predator ant occurrence was unrelated to all environmental variables tested. 5. The species richness of predator ants increased with tree species richness but decreased with leaf functional diversity and shrub cover. Elevation negatively influenced only total ant species richness. 6. The evenness of predators increased with tree species richness, while the evenness of all ants decreased with shrub cover. Omnivore ant evenness decreased with tree evenness, but increased with successional age. 7. The results highlight the value of diverse forests in maintaining species richness and community evenness of a functionally important predator group.

  abstract = {An important question in evolutionary genetics concerns the extent to which adaptive convergence in protein function is caused by convergent or parallel changes at the amino acid level. Even when there is a many-to-one mapping of genotype to phenotype, particular mutations may be preferentially fixed (substitution bias) owing to among-site variation in the rate of mutation to function-altering alleles and/or variation among mutations in their probability of fixation once they arise.Within the set of mutations that have functionally equivalent effects on a selected phenotype, those that incur a lower magnitude of deleterious pleiotropy will generally have higher fixation probabilities. Mutational pleiotropy may therefore represent an important source of substitution bias.A key finding is that the fitness effects of amino acid mutations are often conditional on the genetic background in which they occur. This context dependence (epistasis) reduces the probability of molecular convergence and parallelism because it reduces the number of possible mutations that have unconditionally acceptable effects in divergent genetic backgrounds.Context-dependent mutational effects often stem from pleiotropic trade-offs, as evidenced by cases where the fitness impact of a given mutation is determined by compensatory (conditionally beneficial) mutations at other sites in the same protein.Even if mutations have identical functional effects on a selected phenotype, they can have different fitness effects owing to a nonlinear mapping of phenotype to fitness. Thus, probabilities of convergence and parallelism are reduced by species differences in the genotype-phenotype map and by differences in the phenotype-fitness map.Although computational analyses of sequence variation play a key part in suggesting hypotheses about the causes of convergent and parallel substitutions and their possible adaptive significance, experimental analyses of specific mutations are necessary to test such hypotheses.},

Sprague's Pipit (Anthus spragueii) is a declining grassland specialist with a substantial portion of its population wintering in the highly threatened grasslands of the Chihuahuan Desert. We radio-tagged and tracked 10 wintering pipits between 2014 and 2017 at 3 sites across northern Mexico to generate baseline home range estimates and habitat preferences on their wintering grounds. We found that mean home range and core-use area size with 95\% and 50\% kernel density estimators were 11.4 ha and 2.4 ha, respectively, almost twice as large as some other grassland specialist passerines. Two birds left the study area and one individual shifted its home range 1.3 km after 20 d of monitoring, indicating that some individuals are flexible in their space use strategies. Within their home ranges, pipits selected grasslands with more bare ground and less ``other cover'' (litter, duff, animal excrement, and rocks) than what was available on the landscape. We found no relationship at the microhabitat scale between pipits and grass height nor shrub cover and heights, which in previous studies have been shown to influence habitat selection at larger scales. These findings may reflect different habitat use, diet, and predator avoidance strategies than other grassland passerines that select for denser grass cover during winter in the Chihuahuan Desert and highlight the importance of structurally heterogeneous grasslands. For this reason, strategies to manage and conserve Chihuahuan Desert grasslands and its avifauna must consider the diverse habitat and area needs of grassland birds to be effective.}

  abstract = {The process of adaptive radiation\textemdash the proliferation of species from a single ancestor and diversification into many ecologically different forms\textemdash has been of great interest to evolutionary biologists since Darwin. Since the middle of the last century, ecological opportunity has been invoked as a potential key to understanding when and how adaptive radiation occurs. Interest in the topic of ecological opportunity has accelerated as research on adaptive radiation has experienced a resurgence, fueled in part by advances in phylogenetic approaches to studying evolutionary diversification. Nonetheless, what the term actually means, much less how it mechanistically leads to adaptive diversification, is currently debated; whether the term has any predictive value or is a heuristic useful only for post hoc explanation also remains unclear. Recent recognition that evolutionary change can occur rapidly and on a timescale commensurate with ecological processes suggests that it is time to synthesize ecological and evolutionary approaches to the study of community assembly and evolutionary diversification.},

But citizen-science projects vary in their ability to contribute usefully for science, conservation, or public policy. eBird has evolved from a basic citizen-science project into a collective enterprise, taking a novel approach to citizen science by developing cooperative partnerships among experts in a wide range of fields: population and distributions, conservation biologists, quantitative ecologists, statisticians, computer scientists, GIS and informatics specialists, application developers, and data administrators. The goal is to increase data quantity through participant recruitment and engagement, but also to quantify and control for data quality issues such as observer variability, imperfect detection of species, and both spatial and temporal bias in data collection. Advances at the interface among ecology, statistics, and computer science allow us to create new species distribution models that provide accurate estimates across broad spatial and temporal scales with extremely detailed resolution. eBird data are openly available and used by a broad spectrum of students, teachers, scientists, NGOs, government agencies, land managers, and policy makers. Feedback from this broad data use community helps identify development priorities. As a result, eBird has become a major source of biodiversity data, increasing our knowledge of the dynamics of species distributions, and having a direct impact on the conservation of birds and their habitats.},

Too often, new science is not easily or quickly translated into conservation action. Traditional approaches to data collection and science delivery may be both inefficient and insufficient, as conservation practitioners need access to salient, credible, and legitimate data to take action. Open access data could serve as a tool to help bridge the gap between science and action, by providing conservation practitioners with access to relevant data in near real time. Broad-scale citizen-science data represent a fast-growing resource for open access databases, providing relevant and appropriately scaled data on organisms, much in the way autonomous sensors do so on the environment. Several such datasets are now broadly available, yet documentation of their application to conservation is rare. Here we use eBird, a project where individuals around the world submit data on bird distribution and abundance, as an example of how citizen-science data can be used to achieve tangible conservation science and action at local, regional, and global scales. Our examination illustrates how these data can be strategically applied to improve our understanding of spatial and temporal distributions of birds, the impacts of anthropogenic change on ecological systems, and creative conservation solutions to complex problems. We raise awareness of the types of conservation action now happening with citizen-science data, and discuss the benefits, limitations, and caveats of this approach.},

In recent evolution experiments with microbes, this question has been explored by monitoring the repeatability of adaptive changes in replicate populations. Here, we present the results of an extensive computational study of evolutionary predictability based on an experimentally measured eight-locus fitness landscape for the filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger. To quantify predictability, we define entropy measures on observed mutational trajectories and endpoints. In contrast to the common expectation of increasingly deterministic evolution in large populations, we find that these entropies display an initial decrease and a subsequent increase with population size N, governed, respectively, by the scales N{$\mu$} and N{$\mu$}2, corresponding to the supply rates of single and double mutations, where {$\mu$} denotes the mutation rate. The amplitude of this pattern is determined by {$\mu$}. We show that these observations are generic by comparing our findings for the experimental fitness landscape to simulations on simple model landscapes.},

  abstract = {Predation risk is vital in determining habitat quality. But landscapes of fear are complex and dynamic, such as temperate deciduous forests characterized by intermittent, synchronized production of large seed crops (mast peaks). These ``resource pulses'' elevate the magnitude of predation risk via direct or indirect effects, possibly altering also predator avoidance strategies of a prey. Yet, how animals manage predation risk via informed habitat selection and how this depends on ecological context remains poorly explored. We studied risk-sensitive settlement behavior of wood warbler Phylloscopus sibilatrix. We tested the hypothesis that warblers flexibly avoid predators (Eurasian jays Garrulus glandarius) during habitat selection but that their interactions are mediated by mast seeding, which is known to elevate the overall nest predation risk for warblers through its cascading effects on population dynamics of rodents and generalist predators. We used a playback experiment to manipulate warblers' perceived risk of nest predation by jays. We replicated the experiment in two consecutive years, followed by high or low seed crop. In the spring following mast trough, risky jay plots featured low abundance, late settlement, and poor pairing success compared to other treatments. In contrast, no response differences were found in the spring following mast seeding. Our results suggest that the way wood warblers adjust habitat choices to jay predation risk is indirectly mediated by mast seeding. This highlights plasticity in predator avoidance during prey habitat selection in complex and dynamic landscapes of fear, and the potential effects of mast seeding on animal behavior via indirect interactions.},

  abstract = {Global average temperature increase during the last century has induced species geographic range shifts and extinctions. Montane floras, in particular, are highly sensitive to climate change and mountains serve as suitable observation sites for tracing climate-induced biological response. The Himalaya constitute an important global biodiversity hotspot, yet studies on species' response to climate change from this region are lacking. Here we use historical (1849\textendash 50) and the recent (2007\textendash 2010) data on temperature and endemic species' elevational ranges to perform a correlative study in the two alpine valleys of Sikkim. We show that the ongoing warming in the alpine Sikkim Himalaya has transformed the plant assemblages. This study lends support to the hypothesis that changing climate is causing species distribution changes. We provide first evidence of warmer winters in the region compared to the last two centuries, with mean temperatures of the warmest and the coldest months may have increased by 0.7660.25uC and 3.6562uC, respectively. Warming-driven geographical range shifts were recorded in 87\% of 124 endemic plant species studied in the region; upper range extensions of species have resulted in increased species richness in the upper alpine zone, compared to the 19th century. We recorded a shift of 23\textendash 998 m in species' upper elevation limit and a mean upward displacement rate of 27.53622.04 m/decade in the present study. We infer that the present-day plant assemblages and community structure in the Himalaya is substantially different from the last century and is, therefore, in a state of flux under the impact of warming. The continued trend of warming is likely to result in ongoing elevational range contractions and eventually, species extinctions, particularly at mountaintops.},

  abstract = {This review examines the diversity of avian mixed foraging flocks with the goal of relating the conclusions to primate polyspecific associations. Mixed associations are considered as adaptations for achieving an optimal balance between predator protection and feeding efficiency. In open habitat, predator and prey are able to detect each other at a distance and feeding competition is low, especially in species that subsist on a homogeneously distributed food supply. These conditions favor large groups of variable composition. In closed habitats, predators attack at close range, so early warning alarm systems are at a premium. Feeding competition is often intense because food resources such as fruit, flushing leaves, and nectar are spatially concentrated. Since feeding competition is generally less between than within species, these conditions favor mixed associations composed of small numbers of several to many species, and the evolution of elaborate early warning systems to thwart predators. The primate polyspecific associations that have been studied to date share characteristics with the closed habitat model while exhibiting some important distinctions. Primate associations are made up of integral troops, not individuals, implying high incremental costs of joining. These costs, plus a paucity of ecologically compatible combinations of species, seem to limit primate polyspecific associations geographically to regions in which the presence of monkey-eating raptors provides a strong incentive for aggregation.},

Indian rhinos are basically solitary creatures, but do not resent one another's company. Occasionally, they form temporary associations consisting of either all female or all male in a large lake or at grazing areas. The only strong social bond is the mother-calf unit, which may last for up to 2-3 years. Indian rhinos are reluctant breeders i.e. the desire of courtship and mating behaviour in the male and female do not synchronize all time. Like female, male also undergoes a period of heat and these periods must coincide before mating takes place. Knowledge about the social and reproductive behaviour is important strategic information that should be incorporated into the conservation and management plan for the threatened Indian one-horned rhinos. The present study, conducted between January (2011) to December (2012), provides vital information to strengthen the available data about behaviour of Indian rhinos.},

This study investigated whether aquatic subsidies influence the dynamics of insectivorous birds in entire catchment. We estimated the prey biomass and bird density in riparian and upland habitats in three catchments in temperate deciduous forests in Hokkaido, Japan. Aquatic prey was found only in riparian forests and the biomass peaked in early spring, while terrestrial prey was equally distributed between habitats and increased in biomass in late spring. Bird density was higher in riparian than in upland forests before bud break, when the biomass of aquatic insects peaked, but was similar in both forests during the rest of the seasons. These results suggest that aquatic prey subsidies are used not only by birds inhabiting riparian forests, but also by birds associated with upland forests. Aquatic prey subsidies may be particularly important in the spring as a critical food resource for survival and the breeding activities of birds, thereby, influencing the population dynamics of bird communities.},

The variation in bird effects may be due to characteristics such as plant productivity or quality, habitat complexity, and/or species diversity of predator and prey assemblages. Since agroforestry systems vary in such characteristics, these systems provide a good starting point for understanding when and where we can expect predation by birds to be important. We analyze data from bird exclosure studies in forests and agroforestry systems to ask whether birds consistently reduce their arthropod prey base and whether bird predation differs between forests and agroforestry systems. Further, we focus on agroforestry systems to ask whether the magnitude of bird predation (1) differs between canopy trees and understory plants, (2) differs when migratory birds are present or absent, and (3) correlates with bird abundance and diversity. We found that, across all studies, birds reduce all arthropods, herbivores, carnivores, and plant damage. We observed no difference in the magnitude of bird effects between agroforestry systems and forests despite simplified habitat structure and plant diversity in agroforests. Within agroforestry systems, bird reduction of arthropods was greater in the canopy than the crop layer. Top-down effects of bird predation were especially strong during censuses when migratory birds were present in agroforestry systems. Importantly, the diversity of the predator assemblage correlated with the magnitude of predator effects; where the diversity of birds, especially migratory birds, was greater, birds reduced arthropod densities to a greater extent. We outline potential mechanisms for relationships between bird predator, insect prey, and habitat characteristics, and we suggest future studies using tropical agroforests as a model system to further test these areas of ecological theory.},

Forest edges in the agricultural landscape were older and had vegetation structures that differed from those in the forestry landscape, This resulted in a sharper contrast in microclimate (temperature and humidity) between edge and interior in forests abutting agriculture than in stands abutting recent clearcuts. Arthropods from the leaf-fitter and shrub-layer samples exhibited different responses to edges. In both landscapes, total shrub-arthropod abundance was not significantly affected by edges. while total leaf-litter arthropod abundance was lower at edges than in forest interiors. This reduced abundance of leaf-litter arthropods could negatively affect birds and other insectivorous vertebrates or could have been caused by greater vertebrate predation there. Forest edges in agriculture and forestry landscapes represent relative extremes in edge maturity. demonstrating that age of edges cannot completely mitigate edge effects on microclimate and abundance of arthropods, We discuss the implications of our findings for influences of forest fragmentation and landscape change on forest birds.},

Given a sufficient minimum level of food supply, the difference in food availability between two males' territories may be great enough to permit a female to rear more young on the better territory, unaided by her mate, than she could on the poorer one even with full assistance from her mate. In this case, selection would favor a female pairing with the male on the better territory, even if this meant establishing a polygynous association.},

  abstract = {Habitat quality of a bird's breeding grounds has been typically evaluated by investigating patterns in nesting success, whereas events that follow fledging have been largely ignored. One especially overlooked aspect of breeding-habitat quality is how habitat affects the survival of young birds after they leave the nest, a period when mortality is notoriously high. We studied survival of fledglings of two mature-forest species, the Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla) and Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vermivorum), to identify intrinsic (e.g., age, condition) and extrinsic (e.g., habitat structure) factors that influence survival. From 2004 to 2007, we radio-tagged 51 Ovenbird and 60 Worm-eating Warbler fledglings in southeast Ohio. We recorded the birds' locations daily and compared vegetation structure at the fledglings' and paired random locations. Using known-fate models in program MARK, we calculated post-fledging survival to be 65\% for the Ovenbirds (51 days after fledging) and 67\% for the Worm-eating Warblers (31 days after fledging). Fledglings' condition at the time of radio tagging was positively related to survival after fledging, implying carryover effects from the nestling period. Fledglings of both species used dense vegetation with 40\textendash 60\% more woody stems in the understory than at random locations. Moreover, use of dense vegetation actually promoted survival. Although riparian thickets and tree-fall gaps within some forests may provide abundant habitat for fledglings, other forests may lack the structural attributes that promote fledglings' survival. Our findings highlight the importance of both breeding and post-fledging requirements being considered in avian conservation plans.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated that many birds of mature forests heavily use early-successional habitat during the postbreeding period. Two frequently invoked hypotheses to explain these shifts are that postbreeding birds select (1) dense cover to reduce risk of predation and (2) abundant fruit resources to facilitate foraging. Using mist nets between 15 June and 16 August in 2002 and 2003, we captured mature-forest birds during the postbreeding period in 12 regenerating hardwood clearcuts (three to seven years old) in southeast Ohio. Vegetation structure and fruit resources were measured at nine net locations within each clearcut. We applied an information-theoretic approach, where we used vegetative and fruit variables as predictors in seven a priori models to evaluate how habitat factors might explain capture rates. In two seasons, we captured 1,089 hatch-year (HY) and 445 after-hatch-year (AHY) postbreeding birds of 32 mature-forest species. In general, models reflecting habitat structure (density of low vegetation, canopy height) best explained variation in capture rates, which were negatively related to the density of low vegetation (\&lt;1.5 m) and positively related to canopy height. Extremely dense low vegetation may be disadvantageous if it inhibits movements and provides cryptic locations for ground predators. Instead, habitats with greater vertical structure (e.g., taller vegetation) and relatively less dense low vegetation below may provide better protection from aerial and ground predators. Overall, results suggest that vegetation structure may explain high use of early-successional forests by many birds during the postbreeding period, though fruit may be the most important factor for seasonal frugivores.Recursos Vegetativos y de Frutos como Determinantes del Uso de H\'abitat por Aves de Bosque Maduro Durante el Per\'iodo Posterior a la Reproducci\'on},

In the radiation of the spider genus Dysdera in the Canary Islands, species diversification occurs concomitant with repeated events of trophic specialization. These dietary shifts, to feed primarily on woodlice, are accompanied by modifications in morphology (mostly in the mouthparts), behaviour and nutritional physiology. To gain insight into the molecular basis of this adaptive radiation, we performed a comprehensive comparative transcriptome analysis of five Canary Island Dysdera endemics representing two evolutionary and geographically independent events of dietary specialization. After controlling for the potential confounding effects of hemiplasy, our differential gene expression and selective constraint analyses identified a number of genetic changes that could be associated with the repeated adaptations to specialized diet of woodlice, including some related to heavy metal detoxification and homeostasis, the metabolism of some important nutrients and venom toxins. Our results shed light on the genomic basis of an extraordinary case of dietary shift convergence associated with species diversification. We uncovered putative molecular substrates of convergent evolutionary changes at different hierarchical levels, including specific genes, genes with equivalent functions and even particular amino acid positions. This study improves our knowledge of rapid adaptive radiations and provides new insights into the predictability of evolution.},

Locally induced responses may be particularly important in large plants, such as trees, that show high variability in traits and herbivory rates across their canopies. We studied the branch-localized induction of polyphenols, volatiles (VOCs), and changes in leaf protein content in Carpinus betulus L., Quercus robur L., and Tilia cordata L. in a common garden experiment. To induce the trees, we treated ten individuals per species on one branch with methyl jasmonate. Five other individuals per species served as controls. We measured the traits in the treated branches, in control branches on treated trees, and in control trees. Additionally, we ran predation assays and caterpillar food-choice trials to assess the effects of our~treatment on other trophic levels. Induced VOCs included mainly mono- and sesquiterpenes. Their production was strongly localized to the treated branches in all three tree species studied. Treated trees showed more predation events than control trees. The polyphenol levels and total protein content showed a limited response to the treatment. Yet, winter moth caterpillars preferred leaves from control branches over leaves from treated branches within C. betulus individuals and leaves from control Q. robur individuals over leaves from treated Q. robur individuals. Our results suggest that there is a significant level of localization in induction of VOCs and probably also in unknown traits with direct effects on herbivores. Such localization allows trees to upregulate defences wherever and whenever they are needed.},

Also, we adopted grey relational analysis and power function model to analyze the relevance between crane population and land-use types, and the main habitat types of cranes were obtained. We used principal component analysis method to analyze the main influence factor for habitat selection of crane. The results indicated that the main habitat type of four species of overwintering crane was reed-flat; the main factors affecting the habitat selection of cranes were water level, planktonic biomass, and distance to settlement. Among them, the weight of water level factor was the highest, which showed that water level was the most important factor affecting the habitat selection of cranes, followed by planktonic biomass, and the third was the weight of distance to settlement. The average values of them were 0.37~m, 9.47~mg~L-1, and 1.25~km, respectively.},

  abstract = {Aim While ecologists have long been interested in diversity in mountain regions, elevational patterns in beta diversity are still rarely studied across different life forms ranging from micro- to macroorganisms. Also, it is not known whether the patterns in turnover among organism groups are affected by the degree to which the environment is modified by human activities. Location Laojun Mountain, Yunnan Province, China. Methods The beta diversity patterns of benthic microorganisms (i.e. diatoms and bacteria) and macroorganisms (i.e. macroinvertebrates) in a stony stream were simultaneously investigated between elevations of 1820 and 4050 m. Data were analysed by using a distance-based approach and variation partitioning based on canonical redundancy analysis. Results Analyses of community dissimilarities between adjacent sampling sites showed comparable small-scale beta diversity along the elevational gradient for the organism groups. However, bacteria clearly showed the lowest elevational turnover when analyses were conducted simultaneously for all pairwise sites. Variation partitioning indicated that species turnover was mostly related to environmental heterogeneity and spatial gradients including horizontal distance and elevation, while purely human impacts were shown to be less important. Main conclusions The elevational beta diversity at large scales was lower for bacteria than for eukaryotic microorganisms or macroorganisms, perhaps indicative of high dispersal ability and good adaptability of bacteria to harsh environmental conditions. However, the small-scale beta diversity did not differ among the groups. Elevation was the major driver for the turnover of eukaryotic organisms, while the turnover of bacteria was correlated more with environmental variation.},

  abstract = {Human activities may impact animal habitat and resource use, potentially influencing contemporary evolution in animals. In the United Kingdom, COVID-19 lockdown restrictions resulted in sudden, drastic alterations to human activity. We hypothesized that short-term daily and long-term seasonal changes in human mobility might result in changes in bird habitat use, depending on the mobility type (home, parks and grocery) and extent of change. Using Google human mobility data and 872 850 bird observations, we determined that during lockdown, human mobility changes resulted in altered habitat use in 80\% (20/25) of our focal bird species. When humans spent more time at home, over half of affected species had lower counts, perhaps resulting from the disturbance of birds in garden habitats. Bird counts of some species (e.g. rooks and gulls) increased over the short term as humans spent more time at parks, possibly due to human-sourced food resources (e.g. picnic refuse), while counts of other species (e.g. tits and sparrows) decreased. All affected species increased counts when humans spent less time at grocery services. Avian species rapidly adjusted to the novel environmental conditions and demonstrated behavioural plasticity, but with diverse responses, reflecting the different interactions and pressures caused by human activity.},

  abstract = {Parental care of nestling and fledgling American robins, Turdus migratorius, was studied in eastern Ontario. There was no evidence of brood division prior to fledging but brood division was the predominant pattern after fledging. Females initiating second nests reduced their care of fledglings sooner than males. Once incubation began at second nests, males provided all the care for fledglings from the previous nest. A consequence of overlapping first and second nesting efforts is that care of fledglings from the first nest allows males little opportunity of mate guarding when their mates are initiating the second nest. Reduced opportunity for mate guarding is probably excerbated by the wide dispersal of fledglings at the time of egg laying at second nests. In spite of the apparent reduced opportunity for mate guarding, males fed nestlings in second nests as much as those in first nests. This result suggests that females initiating second nests may refrain from extra-pair copulations if their mates have proven themselves by the success of the first nest, because confidence of paternity ensures male parental care at the second nest. Information from the literature suggests that the mixed strategy by females of being willing to engage in extra-pair copulations when initiating first but not second broods may occur in other species with overlapping broods.},

We note three primary approaches to integrating phylogenetic information into studies of community organization: 1. examining the phylogenetic structure of community assemblages, 2. exploring the phylogenetic basis of community niche structure, and 3. adding a community context to studies of trait evolution and biogeography. We recognize a common pattern of phylogenetic conservatism in ecological character and highlight the challenges of using phylogenies of partial lineages. We also review phylogenetic approaches to three emergent properties of communities: species diversity, relative abundance distributions, and range sizes. Methodological advances in phylogenetic supertree construction, character reconstruction, null models for community assembly and character evolution, and metrics of community phylogenetic structure underlie the recent progress in these areas. We highlight the potential for community ecologists to benefit from phylogenetic knowledge and suggest several avenues for future research.}

However, we demonstrate that 102 trajectories are inaccessible to Darwinian selection and that many of the remaining trajectories have negligible probabilities of realization, because four of these five mutations fail to increase drug resistance in some combinations. Pervasive biophysical pleiotropy within the {$\beta$}-lactamase seems to be responsible, and because such pleiotropy appears to be a general property of missense mutations, we conclude that much protein evolution will be similarly constrained. This implies that the protein tape of life may be largely reproducible and even predictable.

  abstract = {I present a quantitative description of the diet of American Robins (Turdus migratorius) and consider how food habits (particularly the proportion of fruit eaten and the diversity of individual meals) are influenced by season, habitat, sex, and time of day. The study is based on an analysis of records of stomach contents compiled by the U.S. Biological Survey and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Across their entire range, robins ate fruits representing over 50 genera and invertebrates representing over 100 families. Diets were diverse even within local regions, and there was no obvious single feeding niche. The major food classes, consumed in every combination, were soft-bodied invertebrates, hard-bodied invertebrates, and fruits. The same taxa (especially fruits of the family Rosaceae and invertebrates of the orders Coleoptera and Lepidoptera) predominated in robins' diets, irrespective of habitat or geographical location, which presumably reflects both selective foraging and the availability of these widespread taxa.The proportion of fruit (by volume) in the diet was much higher in the fall and winter (median values \&gt;90\%) than in the spring (\&lt;10\%); summer values were intermediate. The transition from a diet dominated by invertebrates to a diet dominated by fruits occurred over a 1-2-month period. The number of distinct food items in stomachs, a measure of the species diversity of individual meals, was positively correlated with the fraction of invertebrates in the diet. Thus, at the time of year when robins were dependent on fruits for food, the diversity of their meals was also lowest. The degree of fullness of the stomach showed few consistent trends with season or habitat.Despite different sex roles and nutritional requirements, male and female robins did not differ in the proportion of fruit in the diet in any month or in any region. Nor did their stomachs contain different numbers of distinct food items, different amounts of food, or a different range or distribution of prey taxa. Habitat was an important variable explaining dietary differences.The Biological Survey records have unavoidable shortcomings, most notably problems of sampling biases and the inability to correct for differential digestion of food items. Nonetheless, they are a valuable and underused data base for testing hypotheses, generating new questions of ecological interest, and describing in detail the diets of North American bird species.},

We determined habitat preferences by quantifying patch-use intensity. 2 Patch-use intensity was greater in the breeding season than in the non-breeding season, and in interior than in edge habitat. In addition, however, we found interactions among the habitat variables. For instance, these bird species showed significant preferences for foraging in woodland interior habitat and on large diameter trees in the breeding season, but not in the non-breeding season. 3 Foraging preferences were further affected by understorey clearing, with preference for interior over edge habitat reversed in the cleared habitat in the non-breeding season. This effect may reflect unintended consequences of topography, an uncontrolled factor outside the experiment protocol. 4 Overall, the results suggest that patch-use results from the response of the bird species to effects of vegetation variation from edge to interior habitat on both microclimate and predation risk. Those effects of vegetation may disappear or diminish when understorey vegetation is removed or reduced.},

  abstract = {We present evidence that the heritable genetic variation within individual species, especially dominant and keystone species, has community and ecosystem consequences. These consequences represent extended phenotypes, i.e., the effects of genes at levels higher than the population. Using diverse examples from microbes to vertebrates, we demonstrate that the extended phenotype can be traced from the individuals possessing the trait, to the community, and to ecosystem processes such as leaf litter decomposition and N mineralization. In our development of a community genetics perspective, we focus on intraspecific genetic variation because the extended phenotypes of these genes can be passed from one generation to the next, which provides a mechanism for heritability. In support of this view, common-garden experiments using synthetic crosses of a dominant tree show that their progeny tend to support arthropod communities that resemble those of their parents. We also argue that the combined interactions of extended phenotypes contribute to the among-community variance in the traits of individuals within communities. The genetic factors underlying this among-community variance in trait expression, particularly those involving genetic interactions among species, constitute community heritability. These findings have diverse implications. (1) They provide a genetic framework for understanding community structure and ecosystem processes. The effects of extended phenotypes at these higher levels need not be diffuse; they may be direct or may act in relatively few steps, which enhances our ability to detect and predict their effects. (2) From a conservation perspective, we introduce the concept of the minimum viable interacting population (MVIP), which represents the size of a population needed to maintain genetic diversity at levels required by other interacting species in the community. (3) Genotype \texttimes{} environment interactions in dominant and keystone species can shift extended phenotypes to have unexpected consequences at community and ecosystem levels, an issue that is especially important as it relates to global change. (4) Documenting community heritability justifies a community genetics perspective and is an essential first step in demonstrating community evolution. (5) Community genetics requires and promotes an integrative approach, from genes to ecosystems, that is necessary for the marriage of ecology and genetics. Few studies span from genes to ecosystems, but such integration is probably essential for understanding the natural world. Corresponding Editor: A. A. Agrawal},

Five hypotheses relate fruit colors directly to avian foraging: (1) birds prefer red and black (weak support at best); (2) red and black displays are more readily discovered by foraging birds (mixed evidence); (3) fruit colors indicate fruit maturity (mixed evidence); (4) fruit colors facilitate quick recognition of food (little evidence); (5) nutritionally poor fruits mimic nutrient-rich fruits (no data). Three hypotheses relate fruit colors to defense against natural enemies: (6) red fruits are inconspicuous to fruit-foraging arthropods (limited applicability); (7) fruit colors exclude poor dispersal agents (few data); (8) fruit pigments defend fruits against parasites and pathogens (no data for present day fruits; may have been important in evolutionary time). In addition, fruit colors may be physiological adaptations (hypothesis 9; little evidence) or may have evolved by selection acting on correlated characters (hypothesis 10; few data). Finally, production of fruit pigments may be constrained by metabolic costs (hypothesis 11; few data), by competition for dispersal agents (hypothesis 12; no data), or by phylogenetic history (hypothesis 13; little support).

  abstract = {Understanding interactions between biota and the built environment is increasingly important as human modification of the landscape expands in extent and intensity. For migratory birds, collisions with lighted structures are a major cause of mortality, but the mechanisms behind these collisions are poorly understood. Using 40 years of collision records of passerine birds, we investigated the importance of species' behavioural ecologies in predicting rates of building collisions during nocturnal migration through Chicago, IL and Cleveland, OH, USA. We found that the use of nocturnal flight calls is an important predictor of collision risk in nocturnally migrating passerine birds. Species that produce flight calls during nocturnal migration tended to collide with buildings more than expected given their local abundance, whereas those that do not use such communication collided much less frequently. Our results suggest that a stronger attraction response to artificial light at night in species that produce flight calls may mediate these differences in collision rates. Nocturnal flight calls probably evolved to facilitate collective decision-making during navigation, but this same social behaviour may now exacerbate vulnerability to a widespread anthropogenic disturbance. Our results also suggest that social behaviour during migration may reflect poorly understood differences in navigational mechanisms across lineages of birds.},

Capture distributions and local movements from north and south (as reflected by net captures) were examined in 17 species. All species showed significant nonrandom distributions. Captures from the north were not more frequent than expected by chance. Local diurnal movements, therefore, do not reflect the known latitudinal movements occurring in these species, which makes it unlikely that local habitat use is simply the result of directional wandering. Although 65\% of captured individuals were first-year birds having no previous experience with tropical rainforest, capture distributions suggested species--specific selectivity to a rather high degree. Also, in the 10 species with adequate sample sizes, distributions between early-- and later-day captures tended to be remarkably constant. Habitat selection in these species may be largely endogenous.}

In this study we used linear models to examine the habitat use of 11 migrant species in northeastern Costa Rica to better understand the influence of food and structural resources on the presence of birds during stopover periods. Our models indicated that frugivorous migrants primarily used food abundance, while insectivorous migrants chiefly used vegetation structure as cues for habitat use during stopover. In addition to habitat use models, we documented fruiting plant phenology and found a general relationship between migrant arrival and the timing of ripe fruit availability. Our results suggest that insectivorous migrants probably rely on structural features when using habitat because it may be inherently difficult to assess cryptic-arthropod availability during a short period of time in a novel habitat, such as stopover periods.},

  abstract = {Morphology mediates the relationship between an organism's body temperature and its environment. Dark organisms, for example, tend to absorb heat more quickly than lighter individuals, which could influence their responses to temperature. Therefore, temperature-\-related traits such as morphology may affect patterns of species abundance, richness, and community assembly across a broad range of spatial scales. In this study, we examined variation in color lightness and body size within butterfly communities across hot and cool habitats in the tropical woodland\textendash rainforest ecosystems of northeast Queensland, Australia. Using thermal imaging, we documented the absorption of solar radiation relative to color lightness and wingspan and then built a phylogenetic tree based on available sequences to analyze the effects of habitat on these traits within a phylogenetic framework. In general, darker and larger individuals were more prevalent in cool, closed-\-canopy rainforests than in immediately adjacent and hotter open woodlands. In addition, darker and larger butterflies preferred to be active in the shade and during crepuscular hours, while lighter and smaller butterflies were more active in the sun and midday hours\textemdash a pattern that held after correcting for phylogeny. Our ex situ experiment supported field observations that dark and large butterflies heated up faster than light and small butterflies under standardized environmental conditions. Our results show a thermal consequence of butterfly morphology across habitats and how environmental factors at a microhabitat scale may affect the distribution of species based on these traits. Furthermore, this study highlights how butterfly species might differentially respond to warming based on ecophysiological traits and how thermal refuges might emerge at microclimatic and habitat scales.},

All bird species consumed similar quantities of caterpillars and beetles, but use of other prey taxa varied. Non-native leafhoppers (Opsius stactagolus) specific to non-native tamarisk (Tamarix chinensis) substantially augmented Lucy's Warbler (Vermivora luciae) diets (49\%), while ants comprised 82\% of Yellow-breasted Chat (Icteria virens) diets. Yellow Warbler (Dendroica petechia) diets were composed of 45\% aquatic midges. All bird species consumed the non-native leafhopper specific to tamarisk. Comparison of bird diets with availability of arthropod prey from aquatic and terrestrial origins showed terrestrial insects comprised 91\% of all avian diets compared to 9\% of prey from aquatic origin. Seasonal shifts in arthropod prey occurred in diets of three bird species, although no seasonal shifts were detected in arthropods sampled in vegetation indicating that at least three bird species were not selecting prey in proportion to its abundance. All bird species had higher prey overlap with arthropods collected in the native, mesquite-acacia vegetation zone which contained higher arthropod diversity and better prey items (i.e., Lepidoptera). Lucy's Warbler and Yellow Warbler consumed high proportions of prey items found in greatest abundance in the tamarisk-dominated vegetation zone that has been established since the construction of Glen Canyon Dam. These species appeared to exhibit ecological plasticity in response to an anthropogenic increase in prey resources.Dieta de Aves Insect\'ivoras a lo largo del R\'io Colorado en el Gran Ca\~non, ArizonaResumen.{$\quad$}Examinamos la dieta de seis especies de aves insect\'ivoras (n = 202 individuos) de dos zonas de vegetaci\'on a lo largo del R\'io Colorado en el Parque Nacional del Gran Ca\~non, Arizona, en 1994. Todas las especies de aves consumieron cantidades similares de orugas y escarabajos, pero el uso de otras presas fue variable. Los Cicadellidae (Hom\'optera) ex\'oticos (Opsius stactagolus) espec\'ificos del tamarisco ex\'otico (Tamarix chinensis) comprendieron una parte sustancial de la dieta de Vermivora luciae (49\%), mientras que las hormigas representaron el 82\% de la dieta de Icteria virens. La dieta de Dendroica petechia incluy\'o un 45\% de d\'ipteros acu\'aticos de la familia Cecidomyiidae. Todas las especies de aves consumieron el cicadellide ex\'otico espec\'ifico del tamarisco. La comparaci\'on de las dietas de aves con la disponibilidad de presas de artr\'opodos de origen acu\'atico y terrestre mostr\'o que los insectos terrestres comprendieron el 91\% de todas las dietas de aves, comparado con un 9\% de presas de origen acu\'atico. Se registraron cambios estacionales en los artr\'opodos de la dieta de tres especies de aves, aunque no se detectaron cambios estacionales en los artr\'opodos muestreados en la vegetaci\'on, indicando que al menos tres especies de aves no estuvieron seleccionando las presas en proporci\'on a su abundancia. Todas las especies de aves presentaron mayor superposici\'on de presas con los artr\'opodos colectados en la zona de vegetaci\'on nativa de mesquite (Prosopis) y Acacia, la cual contuvo mayor diversidad de artr\'opodos y presas de mejor calidad (i.e., Lepidoptera). V. luciae y D. petechia consumieron altas proporciones de presas encontradas en mayor abundancia en la zona de vegetaci\'on dominada por el tamarisco, que ha sido establecida desde la construcci\'on de la Presa Glen Canyon. Estas especies parecieron exhibir plasticidad ecol\'ogica en respuesta a un incremento antropog\'enico en las presas como recuso alimenticio.},

  abstract = {Animals and plants are shifting the timing of key life events in response to climate change, yet despite recent documentation of escalating phenological change, scientists lack a full understanding of how and why phenological responses vary across space and among species. Here, we used over 7\,million community-contributed bird observations to derive species-specific, spatially explicit estimates of annual spring migration phenology for 56 bird species across eastern North America. We show that changes in the spring arrival of migratory birds are coarsely synchronized with fluctuations in vegetation green-up and that the sensitivity of birds to plant phenology varied extensively. Bird arrival responded more synchronously with vegetation green-up at higher latitudes, where phenological shifts over time are also greater. Critically, species' migratory traits explained variation in sensitivity to green-up, with species that migrate more slowly, arrive earlier and overwinter further north showing greater responsiveness to earlier springs. Identifying how and why species vary in their ability to shift phenological events is fundamental to predicting species' vulnerability to climate change. Such variation in sensitivity across taxa, with long-distance neotropical migrants exhibiting reduced synchrony, may help to explain substantial declines in these species over the last several decades.},

Yet the biased spatial coverage of VGI observations often undermines the fitness of use of VGI samples for predictive mapping. Although methods have been developed to mitigate spatial bias in VGI samples to improve predictive model performance, there exist limited investigations into the impacts of VGI sample size and spatial distribution characteristics on the effectiveness of the methods. This article presents an empirical evaluation on how the two factors affect the effectiveness of bias mitigation methods with a case study of mapping habitat suitability of the red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) using eBird data. Results reveal positive correlations between model performance improvement and sample size, given samples of similar spatial configuration. VGI samples with more spread-out spatial coverage (i.e., more representative) are more amenable to bias mitigation. However, performance improvement plateaued beyond a certain sample size and sample representativeness thresholds.},

Studies have also concentrated on small spatial scales. Whether top-down control is relatively more important at large spatial scales in the most highly diverse tropical or warm temperate forests is still in doubt. 3. Synthesis. The importance of top-down predator control of herbivores may vary with the system studied. Future work to understand the controls of herbivores needs to precisely monitor and compare the dynamics of individual herbivore species and their predators at a large spatial scale.},
