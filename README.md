# Vitae

Repo for my CV and resumes. I used RMarkdown with [`vitae`](https://pkg.mitchelloharawild.com/vitae/reference/) from 2020 to 2025, after which I shifted to Quarto markdown using [a Typst implementation of the same AwesomeCV](https://github.com/kazuyanagimoto/quarto-awesomecv-typst/).

**Archive:** See past versions of my CV (2018--22) [here](https://github.com/rikudoukarthik/vitae/tree/e242e1785b4cb4059cc1ac01f007765b1761cf62/past_versions).
