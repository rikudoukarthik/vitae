# Markdown text

Nice formatting---including Pandoc's *Smart Punctuation* where one star is italics and not bold.

# Resume entries

```{r}
#| output: asis

library(typstcv)
library(dplyr)

tribble(
  ~title, ~location, ~date, ~description, ~details,
  
  "Title", 
  "Location", 
  "01--02 Jan 2025",
  "Input here with '--'",
  "Detail which uses an em-dash---lovely! *Bold* works but not with **two stars**. _Italics_ also works but with underscores."
) |>
  resume_entry(details = "details")
```

```{=typst}
#resume-entry(title: "Title",
              location: "Location",
              date: [01--02 Jan 2025],
              description: "Input here with '--' enclosed in quotes does not work",)
#resume-item[
- Detail which uses an em-dash---lovely! *Bold* works but not with **two stars**. _Italics_ also works but with underscores.
]
